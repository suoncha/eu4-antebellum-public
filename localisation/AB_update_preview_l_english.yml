 LANDING_updated_ante_bellum_TEXT:0 "Ante Bellum is an alternative history mod currently centered around Europe, East Asia and parts of the Middle East. The main idea of the mod is to preserve the base game gameplay without flooding the game with new mechanics while also offering new and fresh gameplay experience, provided by the addition of new countries, mission trees, events and such."
 LANDING_updated_ante_bellum_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "Following the defeat of the Hussites in Bohemia, Europe had enjoyed some years of internal peace and stability. But everything is about to change. The crushing defeat of the Holy Roman Empire at the Battle of Valencia has recently ended the Iberian Crusade in favour of the Andalusians, the retreating armies leaving the Frankish Emperor dead on the battlefield alongside his only son.In the aftermath, the throne was hastily occupied by the late Emperor’s old and loathsome uncle Lothair, who has yet to produce a legitimate heir. Should Lothair die without a successor, his passing would not only mean extinction for the Carolingian dynasty, but also great turmoil within the Holy Roman Empire and its immediate neighbours."

 LANDING_updated_right_of_conquest_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "Forged in the crucible of war, the illustrious war hero Nizzar the Great ousted his Ayyubid overlords long ago, quickly coming to dominate much of the Levant and Egypt. Alas, the great Sultan's descendants have thus far proven unworthy to carry his name, dragging the sultanate down the path of ruination. In their most recent blunder, the renowned Egyptian army was left dead on the field by Jerusalem, which proceeded to take Sidon as its due. Lest they make the same mistake twice, the entire state is being rebuilt from the ground up by its ambitious new sovereign, whose sole ambition is to eradicate Latin rule in the Near East. With the Nizzarid state now resurgent once more, murmurs behind closed doors indicate the Crusaders are afraid - afraid of the retribution they face in the oncoming storm.  The Nizzarids march to war, and the Holy Land shall be theirs, by Right of Conquest!"

 LANDING_updated_pagan_fury_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "Far beyond the borders of Christendom lies the mysterious and untamed Baltic region, a land of amber and spirits, barely touched by the Holy Roman Empire's settlers. Little ever enters or leaves, save for shaken Hanseatic merchants bringing back mountains of amber stone, and tales of the wrath and fury of ancient gods. However, recent incursions by the Teutonic Order at the behest of the Hansa, as well as a solitary Northern Crusade waged by Sweden, are slowly but surely encroaching upon the pagans' hallowed ground. A clash between two worlds is inevitable; will the pagan gods answer the pleas of their faithful, or shall the region fall to its knees before the triumphant Cross?"

 LANDING_updated_heirs_of_ruthenia_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "Two centuries have passed since the Kievan Rus buckled under the weight of the mighty Mongol Empire and collapsed. Ever since then, the princedoms of the Rus' have been subjected to the beck and call of their foreign slavedrivers, yet this may not be for much longer. The hegemony of Genghis Khan's heirs is rapidly disintegrating, with the Khanates of Central Asia collapsing entirely, and isolating the Golden Horde among a sea of disloyal tributaries. With the Great Khan's warlords no longer capable of imposing their rule over the mighty Rus', the Tatar Yoke's stranglehold weakening, the Kievan Rus' successors wage war for freedom, and for unity. Who shall emerge as the true Heir of Ruthenia?"

 LANDING_updated_empires_downfall_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "The untimely demise of the Frankish emperor and his only son at the bloody Battle of Valencia saw to Christendom's failure in the Andalusian Crusade. This crippling blunder has sent shockwaves tearing through much of Western and Central Europe as the Catholics reel in horror. The late Frankish emperor’s hated uncle, Lothair, now dons the mantles of both Holy Roman Emperor and Rex Francorum - though the aging tyrant's reign is beginning to come apart at the seams; His failure to produce any legitimate heirs may very well spiral into a succession crisis which could decide the fate of not just the Carolingian dynasty, but Europe as whole. In Andalusia, the victorious Caliph returns to his capital in solemn procession, all the while his treacherous subjects pose an even greater threat to the realm than the Christians as a civil war is looming on the horizon. The die has been cast. What shall come of these empires?"

 LANDING_updated_the_dragon_throne_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "While the Red Turban Rebellion may have failed to dethrone the Mongol invaders, it nevertheless succeeded in exposing the Great Yuan’s weak spots. With everything south of the Yellow River in rebel hands, the Borjigin Clan’s claim to the Mandate of Heaven is weaker than ever before. To even the most disinterested, it appears that the empire which Kublai Khan had spent his life building may soon come crashing down. The Lord of Ten Thousand Years’ court is paralysed by vicious political deadlock, and even as the seams begin to burst, Yuan still hobbles along its doomed path. From the fearsome Daimyo in Japan to the rugged merchant-monks of the Tarim Basin, and even within the house of cards that is China, none can avert their gaze from the gathering storm. After all, whomever emerges the strongest has a chance to seize the most coveted prize of all: the Dragon Throne!"

 LANDING_updated_legacy_of_seljuk_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "As the ailing Byzantine Empire's borders receded, threats from both East and West struck with unmatched ferocity. The former envy of the known world now lies paralysed, the corrupt and inept Angelos dynasty steering their ship headlong into Bulgarian cavalry, erstwhile the military junta of Nicaea seeks to topple Constantinople's Roman legacy. To achieve such lofty ambitions, however, the Seljuks and their wayward Beyliks must be overcome, though a Turkish future for Anatolia and beyond is not out of the question. They may have stagnated, but their recent conversion to Islam at behest of the Ayyubids serves only to strengthen the Star and Crescent. With the last vestiges of Mongol rule in the west now isolated, the Ilkhans and Golden Horde may seek to lash out in a final offensive, even as they buckle under their own weight. The Near East lurches toward another crisis; war is on the horizon."

 LANDING_updated_pendragon_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "Formerly the proud hegemons of rugged Britannia, England is now subdued by a wicked malaise, the sons of Hengest and Horsa having grown fat and complacent. Turning a blind eye to the troubles ahead, and snubbing the Cyning's desperate pleas for unity, the English may soon see the kingdom erode beneath their feet - no matter how much they refuse to believe it. From the Welsh and Cornish, to the Scots and Irish, England’s old rivals now stand behind her with daggers poised, eager to seek a most bloody retribution. Meanwhile, across the Channel, the Normans patiently count the days until they can stake a claim to their old enemy’s throne, for a third and final time. With the Isles on the eve of all-out war, some pray that, in their hour of need, they shall be led to salvation by the Once and Future King: the Pendragon!"

 LANDING_updated_princes_of_persia_FLAVOR_TEXT:2 "Falling prey to hostile incursions on all sides, the Sassanids chose shame and subjugation over utter annihilation. From a pyrrhic withdrawal in the wake of Rashidun assault, to subjugation at the hands of their own Turkic mercenaries, and furthermore prostrating themselves before the Mongol Empire - the past millennium has rendered the Eranshahr a feeble ruin. The Ilkhanate's collapse should have spurred the Persian satrapies into action; uniting against a common oppressor for a better tomorrow. Alas, from the Zagros to the Indus, warlords aplenty have carved petty kingdoms out of Persia's desiccated carcass. Like moths to a flame, they seek only glory, marching into legend as the founders of a new Iran. Amongst these princes of Persia, however, there can be only one Shahanshah!"
