 ab_bogdanoff.1.d:0 "Rumours have caught up wind of the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName], a brilliant scientist, born of [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] and [bogdanoff_host_country.Culture.GetName] noble lineage, recently published multiple articles in prestigious institutions such as the University of Toulouse and the University of Orléans, expanding upon the work of Nicholas of Cusa in the field of astronomy, bringing new light to issues raised by Cardinal Cusa on the nature of the sun, what is the centre of the universe, and the thesis that celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, neither have circular orbits."
 ab_bogdanoff.1.a:0 "Excellent! bring him to court!"
 ab_bogdanoff.1.b:0 "We must stick to our own talent, these folk from Rus' don't seem trustworthy"
 ab_bogdanoff.2.t:0 "The Bogdanoff Affair"
 ab_bogdanoff.2.d:0 "The worst has come to pass, our hired advisor, Igor Bogdanoff, has recently come under fire from multiple [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] academics, a deeper reading of his recently published papers revealed them to be a word salad with no scientific rigour, written only to stitch together concepts meant to maximise the pre-conceived notions of the University Personnel responsible for checking papers.\n\nThis scandal is currently contained to the Academics of [Root.GetName] but unless we act fast it can spill over and bring serious questions upon [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s best judgment, most of our advisors wish to permanently exile this miscreant back to [bogdanoff_host_country.GetName], while some of our advisors see the potential in a man that fooled prestigious universities, and wish to pay off the academics and re-assign Bogdanoff as a Minister of Propaganda."
 ab_bogdanoff.2.a:0 "Exile him to [bogdanoff_host_country.GetName]! permanently!"
 ab_bogdanoff.2.b:0 "Open the chest to make the academics shut up and make him our Minister of Propaganda"
