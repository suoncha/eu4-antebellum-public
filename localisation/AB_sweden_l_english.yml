 ab_swe_scanian_uprising_desc:0 "The good men of Scania, christians loyal and true, find themselves oppressed by their foul Viking overlords. Their devotion to God has earned them scorn and oppression. Only time will tell how this conflict will proceed."
 ab_swe_call_crusade_title:0 "Call of the Crusade"
 ab_swe_call_crusade_desc:0 "Sweden stands converted, taught of the glory of God. His light surely radiates across Scandinavia, but even still, evil permeates this land. Ignorance drowns out all His wisdom. Violence is the only language spoken in this ancient region - so let us remember how to speak it ourselves and reignite the crusade!"

 ab_swe_laponia_title:0 "Secure Laponia"
 ab_swe_laponia_desc:0 "The Sámi of the cold, lonely north are uncivilised and strange people. Reindeer herders, barbaric snow-treaders and most importantly, heathens. Surely, they will be better off under our rule, knowing the glory of Christ."
 ab_swe_finland_title:0 "Conquer Finland"
 ab_swe_finland_desc:0 "The ancient and wise Finnish, uncivilised yet dignified all at once, deserve to know Christ’s wisdom. No longer shall they clamour under dark foliage, lost in the barren pines - under our protection, they will join Christ’s flock!"
 ab_swe_hakkapeliitta_title:0 "Integrate the Hakkapeliitta"
 ab_swe_hakkapeliitta_desc:0 "We’ve noticed that our newfound Finnish subjects make marvellous light cavalrymen when provided equipment, training and (regrettably) food. The Hakkapeliitta, as they are referred to, would make an excellent and ferocious addition to our forces."
 ab_swe_fall_denmark_title:0 "Christianize Denmark"
 ab_swe_fall_denmark_desc:0 "The Danes are an ancient and formidable rival. They stand as the gatekeepers of the Baltic, guarding doggedly the stepping stones that connect Germany to Scandinavia. Their faith in their old and twisted ways is strong, but we have found that Christ can break any chain, no matter the strength."
 ab_swe_bane_of_the_hansa_title:0 "Bane of the Hansa"
 ab_swe_bane_of_the_hansa_desc:0 "The Hansa stands for nothing but greed. They are an ill-gotten rabble of merchants who would gladly sell out their own for simple coin. Judases, in all but name - despite all their wealth and connections, they would sooner see their pockets full than Christianity flourish in the cold north. Enough is enough!"
 ab_swe_viking_fleets_title:0 "Rival the Viking Fleets"
 ab_swe_viking_fleets_desc:0 "The accursed Vikings, the eternal enemy of our conversion efforts and the dominant force in Scandinavia, are renowned for their horrific naval might. Their dreadful ships lay waste to coastal villages, render to ashes innocent ports and have tarnished many a city with their might. Enough is enough - this maritime strength must be countered and crushed, once and for all!"
 ab_swe_pirates_title:0 "Seize Visby"
 ab_swe_pirates_desc:0 "Visby, while renowned as a powerful trade port and gateway to Gotland’s interior, is also the greasy den of insidious Vikings and wily pirates. These fools have plagued our adjacent coastlines and terrorised the Baltic as a whole without end. They must be quelled!"

 ab_swe_sound_toll_title:0 "Control the Sound Toll"
 ab_swe_sound_toll_desc:0 "The Sound Toll, a mercantile gateway that bridges the cold North Sea and the frigid Baltic, lies within our hands at long last. However, it has certainly seen better days. Pour some golden coins, heavenly devotion and a dash of preferential treatment to our own merchants and we will surely make Sweden richer!"
 ab_swe_vikings_title:0 "Rout the Vikings"
 ab_swe_vikings_desc:0 "The accursed Norwegians have terrorised God's good world for long enough. Let us claim these desolate mountains and treacherous shorelines for the Kingdom of God. New pastures and peaceful farmlands will prosper beneath our banner and his protection. No longer shall this land know the violent rage of the Berserkir. Wolves shall be tamed - rendered an innocent flock of sheep."
 ab_swe_sea_markets_title:0 "North Sea Markets"
 ab_swe_sea_markets_desc:0 "With unchallenged control over the North Sea's most predominant port cities and entrepots, we have potential to stand as a mercantile superpower. We must rebuild the old Viking marketplaces, revitalise the trading outposts, provide ample and safe lanes of trade to and from our ports. Only then shall we stand tall."

 ab_swe_stormaktstiden_desc:0 "Never before has Scandinavia known such total hegemonic control. Norway, Sweden and more stand beneath our banner - united in faith, overflowing with Coin and a true Kingdom of God on Earth. The Stormaktstiden is at hand - a Scandinavian Empire, through and through!"
 ab_swe_noteborg_title:0 "Found Nöteborg"
 ab_swe_noteborg_desc:0 "To the southeast of Finland are ample, rich and lush marshes, rife with rivers, lakes and localities fit for our empire's unending expansion. Uncivilised as these bogs stand, there is great potential for expansion. Our burghers propose a brave and vital new settlement, Nöteborg, to serve as a gateway to this frontier. We shall build it!"
 ab_swe_baltic_warfleet_title:0 "Baltic Warfleet"
 ab_swe_baltic_warfleet_desc:0 "As a beacon of Christendom in Scandinavia and the Baltic as a whole, we have a special duty to claim naval superiority in the region. Heathens of all flavours run rampant, sullying God’s Earth, threatening to persist in their foul ways and even expand their territories, God forbid. Starting with the frigid waters of the Baltic, Christ’s word must flourish, carried by maritime power!"
 ab_swe_riga_title:0 "Archbishopric of Riga"
 ab_swe_riga_desc:0 "Riga stands lonely in a sea of heathen dangers. We cannot let this vital city fall into unkempt, unfaithful hands. Riga must remain within the Kingdom of God!"
 ab_swe_orders_title:0 "Establish the Orders"
 ab_swe_orders_desc:0 "The Baltic is a wild and dangerous place, yet surely it may be civilised yet. From all over Christian Europe, valiant devoted volunteers - perhaps merely opportunistic and bored, but God may sort them out in the end - pour into our borders, ready to fight the good fight. Let us grant them a new frontier, a new challenge, a new untamed place to teach of the Lord's wisdom."
 ab_swe_danzig_title:0 "Seize Danzig"
 ab_swe_danzig_desc:0 "Attempts at civilising the unkempt and deranged forests of Prussia have failed utterly. The Hansa, the Germans and more have peppered the coastlines with pathetic attempts at guiding these fools to the light. No more - with Christ in our hearts and the Lord’s breath filling our sails, we will make landfall. We will civilise this land for good, starting with Danzig!"
 ab_swe_colleges_title:0 "Marine Colleges"
 ab_swe_colleges_desc:0 "With our unchallenged control over the North Sea and Baltic, as well as our long history as a sailing, water-bound people, we must empower our knowledge and let it proliferate. Marine colleges must be founded so that the next generation of sailors is all the more knowledgeable than the last. The wisdom of the previous generation must not be lost - warriors of the high seas, marines as they are called, must be trained!"
 ab_swe_iceland_title:0 "Control the North Sea"
 ab_swe_iceland_desc:0 "The North Sea's most cold and treacherous reaches are vital stepping stones to greater expansion. For centuries, the Norwegians have lorded over these distant and isolated domains, having a monopoly on the lands told of in the sagas. No longer - Sweden deserves these mythical and lost islands!"
 ab_swe_greenland_title:0 "Return to Greenland"
 ab_swe_greenland_desc:0 "In old times, our ancestors sailed far and wide. The sagas speak of great adventures to unknown lands - some said to be true. One of these is that of fabled Greenland - an icy and desolate place to the far northwest. It would be best to reclaim these lost wastes and bring some civilisation back to the coastline, lest this rightful clay fall into the wrong hands!"
