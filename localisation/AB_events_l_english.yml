 #Nationalism

 institution_events.100.d:0 "The imperialism and colonialism of past centuries spurred the conceptualisation of a new doctrine of thought in Europe which gained traction in the 19th Century. Nationalism, as it is known, encompasses numerous ideologies which extol the desire of a people to attain self-determination and sovereignty over their homeland. The resulting concepts of nationhood and national pride, closely woven around a group’s common language, religion, and culture, spawn territorial irredentism associated with ancestral or historical claims. The distinct national identities established within the cultural zeitgeist encourage greater national unity and preferential treatment towards countrymen, but consequently the same ideas entrench themselves in separatist movements and revanchist rhetoric."

 ab_brittany.1.d:0 "An ancient people crushed under Caesar long ago, the Gauls were once thought to have disappeared from memory; dispersed and integrated into the dominant Latin and Germanic populations of Western Europe. It would appear, however, that court chroniclers thought wrong. Indeed, an ever-expanding Breton realm has laid waste to the French countryside, claiming the legacy of both the Gauls and Britons. Yes, these descendants of the Romano-British, who had fled to Roman Gallia during the Saxon Invasion, are promising a pan-Celtic identity for the European continent. Union between the Bretons, Aquitainians, and many others is their master plan. Although their languages may now be heavily influenced by the French of their neighbours, the Celtic roots of these overlooked peoples are as tough as steel. Nothing could have prepared the Latins for what was to come; neither the crushing defeat of the French, nor of a miniscule duchy rapidly overwhelming Western Europe. The emergent Gallic state hoists its banner high up from the cathedral spires and fortress battlements across France. Gallic emissaries now insist that the old name of "Gallia" be restored, for use in correspondence and cartography, and are gleefully browbeating neighbours into recognition. What the future holds for the new Gallic realm is unknown as of yet, though many in what is left of the Empire now fear that they will be next."

With rallying cries calling upon those first Gaul to bring Rome to her knees, and of the tragic king and hero Vercingetorix, few could have anticipated such a potent threat. The very heart of Italy and the Latins is crushed in Gallia's steely grip; the Eternal City's ruination serves as much of a propaganda victory as it does a spiritual and moral one. Flames spreading from hill to hill spare only the Vatican, but the millennia-long legacy of Rome exists no more, by the Tiber at least. Furthermore, the Gallic sovereign has made preparations to conduct a reenactment of Brennus' own tribute-collecting and subjugation of Rome, sealing the total and utter humiliation of the once-proud nucleus of Europe. At long last, Gaul's dream of vengeance has come to fruition, with the Romans now understanding the terror they sowed at Alesia."

They begged and pleaded for angels to come down from above, for their savior to rescue them, but they must have been of little faith as none came to stop our advance. \n \nAs we approached the mighty cathedral of Aachen, a monument toward the Christian God, one of our men murmured something to himself; burn it down. The man beside him began to nod his head, believing the same. Burn it down. The murmurs became chants, which then became a rousing cheer from across our entire ranks. The general grabbed a nearby torch, chucking it into a patch of dry wood nearby the mighty structure. \n \nThat night, in the smoldering ruins of a once great cathedral, we dined on meat and mead as our songs of glory howled into the night through the open roof."

Ballads were sung, and tales told, of Harald Hardrada's heroic end, and of the sole Norseman who blocked the English advance before falling to an act of dishonour. The Norwegians have mourned this loss for an age, clinging tightly to the desire to exact retribution upon those perfidious Angles and Saxons. Such a lust for revenge has at long last been sated, much to the rapturous victory cries of the bloodied Norwegian army, many of whom were descended from the survivors of the first Battle of Stamford Bridge. Now that the Norsemen stand victorious upon a battlefield littered with dead Englishmen, their general sacrificed to honour the gods for granting victory, the skalds back home are sure to eternalise the moment in folklore, and it shall linger in the Sagas forevermore as a triumph which paved the way to further glory. Hardrada is now avenged, but much work is still to be done, for this victory must be capitalised upon."

For the first time since Ragnar Lodbrok carved a bloody path up the Seine in the 9th Century, Norsemen stand triumphant atop the city walls. Unlike then, however, no amount of ransom can spare the city from the wrath of the Old Gods.

The sounds of skirmishing across the last few contested positions blended vividly with the smell of smoke blanketing the lower quarters, having been engulfed in flames mere hours prior. The City of the World's Desire has been reduced to a smouldering husk, the legendary Miklagard is now tamed by those Varangians who had once been in its employ. Pivoting back towards the Hagia Sophia's gilded doors, the King triumphantly made his way inside, his retinue dispersing to tear down the mosaics and other decorations, all the while wondering: why would the Greeks worship a God who has abandoned them, in their most desperate hour?

However, our victories were cut short by the Gaelic High Kings, who drove us out under the name of their God and with their armies of clansmen. While we always wished to one day return, to reclaim what was ours, we had far greater matters to attend to across the seas, and let Ireland slip further and further away. However, during their peasant uprisings of the late 14th Century against the English, those who were descendants of the Norsemen yet worshipped the Christian God came to us. They begged for help, insisting upon the bonds of our forefathers that we must send aid; we obliged, sending weapons and supplies to these revolts, and watched as Dublin, Waterford, and Cork successfully threw off their Marcher lords. \n \n This reminded us, invigorated us, and emboldened our Chieftains to look back on the island as a home for the Norse people. We prepared our invasion, even as the doddering old fool of a High King in Connacht tried to stand against us and unite the isle. Now the High King of Ireland lays defeated at our feet; he begs for mercy from the great heathen army, but he shall receive none.

Upon the coast of the port we seized the lighthouses and guard towers, to slow response to our raiders. We extinguished the warning flames and then wreaked havoc upon the city, utterly dark save our fearsome torches. From Alexandria we seized the greatest treasures of the Orient: fine Jewels, Dates, Silk, Rugs, Spices, Coffee, even some of the lovely ladies of the Sultan's Harem! Our greatest seizure, if I might be so bold to say, is purportedly the body of Alexander the Great, or at least that's what the natives who I killed claimed when I took it from them.

Such great ease we had pilfering the city that we captured the Venetian Senate and began subjecting its senators to all sorts of humiliations. We took from them the loot which they had themselves stolen in their participation in the Crusades, making any objection to our repossession utterly hypocritical. Some individuals, in mockery of Venetian traditions, cut off the faces of some captured patricians and wore them as masks whilst drinking their wine. Venice being a center of mediterranean trade has quarters for peoples as diverse as the Turks, Greeks, Persians and Moors, and so when we captured it so did we gain hostages from all over the world.

Like the Romans before them, they were mistaken. As our warriors ran up the shores and laid waste to their pathetic garrison, their weak Allah seemed content to watch as we pillaged their mosques, razed their farms, and had our way with their wives.

 ab_norway.14.d:0 "As our captain looked over the great port of Malacca, he motioned to us to be careful. He knelt down beside us on our longships, pointing to the city as he began to inform us of the plan. Malacca was wealthy, this was true, but it was not without risk. It was at the heart of the east Asian trade, the port by which spices, tea, and silk sailed to Europe. While there was bounty to be made, it also had robust and effective defensive measures. Not only were there canons along the city walls, but there were also hundreds of trade ships patrolling the seas, waiting to catch pirates that might sail by. He smirked and continued to tell us of the plan he had in mind. But all I could do was stare at the city in trepidation; this could be our riskiest raid yet. \n \n The city was glowing in a bright orange haze, as fire leapt from one building to another. The captain had hired some Orang Laut pirates to sail ships filled with explosives and gunpowder into the city under the cover of night and get the explosives next to the tightly crowded shantytowns. When ignited, the fire would spread throughout the city, and while their defenses were too busy putting out the flames, we would sail in and take all their relics. I rushed through the city and began to ransack houses, markets, anything that I could find. If a soldier got in-between me and a target, I would cut him down, simple as. However, I stopped when I saw a mosque, recognizing it from a raid we pulled on Alexandria. I rushed in, looking for valuables, but as I did, I stopped to think about how Islam, a faith practiced in Egypt, even got all the way over in this corner of the world. After harassing a local preacher, I retreated from the city with my loot, content. \n \n The next morning, while we performed ritual offerings to the Gods, I talked with our captain. I told him about what I learned: the faith came to this land on the backs of trade ships. If we could establish communities in the region, perhaps even our traditions of worship and praise could spread to these far-flung communities? The captain liked what I had to say and ordered me to speak with the rest of the Jarls when we returned to the homeland; we would establish Norse communities across the world!"

Our reputation for piracy and plunder precedes us, so perhaps it should not be surprising that we would be approached by these Kingdoms for trade and diplomacy to save themselves from desolation. Yet a proposition from the Emperor of China was far from expected, especially in his bizarre request. It seems the ruler of the city of Canton has been a stubbornly sovereign citizen who has ceased to pay proper tribute to the Son of Heaven. This inconvenience has led to his Majesty approaching us: he has commanded that we extract that tribute from this brigand and in return we would be allowed to keep a part of the spoil and be relieved of our own obligation to give tribute to the rightful ruler of the world. Ignoring the pathological condescension of the Chinese, this deal was quite sweet, for the Middle Kingdom provided several resources invaluable to the successful raid, namely skilled engineers who had familiarity with the architecture of southern cities. With these warrior bureaucrats we successfully exploited a structural fault of the Canton walls to slip through the provincial defenses. As swift as a coursing river, we swept through with the force of a great typhoon. Truly did we rarely come about a trove as rich as that of this chinese town: of the great wonders we had taken in the years of our ascension here was it multiplied thousands fold. Even having to share it with the Forbidden city there was more than enough to share amongst the men and return to the capital with bounteous reward. Paradoxically it seems this violent incursion has improved our relationship with the Imperial Court and we may one day reap ripe fruits from the seeds sown today."

While we plundered and ransacked the region, we came across a strange group of soldiers. These warriors, who called themselves samurai, had recently codified a doctrine called Bushido. This doctrine of wisdom, discipline, and honor had spoken to some of our raiders; not in its calls for peace and tranquility, but in the calls for self-sacrifice, honor, and duty. Captains who took part in the raid, the same ones that found scrolls and texts about this code in Settsu, took this message to heart, implementing it within their ranks. Eventually this pseudo-bushido code spread like wildfire throughout our military, with each soldier making their own interpretation of the texts as they heard of it. It is said a few even began practicing their own form of Zen Buddhism, but this was heavily debated as many would be seen practicing meditation of martial arts, yet still give offerings to Odin and Thor."

Leading the invasion was his son, Toghon Khan, who upon landing in southern Kyushu, eradicated and routed the Japanese forces. He removed the Kamakura Shogun, forcing him and his court to flee to the Kanto region while they established a new Shogunate in Kyoto. Following this event, various generals from across the Empire, from Korea to Canton all settled in the free and open lands that they had conquered to the west of Kyoto, forming a new Mongol base of power in the region. While the east never was properly conquered by Mongol forces, it still paid tribute whilst it fought amongst itself to establish dominance in the post-Kamakura landscape. Toghon himself settled in the capital, creating the Toyouji line of Shoguns, and ruled over all Japan as its undisputed master. \n \nHowever, as time passed, issues became apparent. The Toyouji dynasty found itself unable to keep many of these new Daimyo of theirs under control, as many of them had armies large enough to challenge their own. As such, infighting amongst the Daimyo continued until eventually, it reached a breaking point, and many are now even explicitly preparing to attack the Toyouji. While [Root.Monarch.GetName] claims to have control over the isle, their grip is in fact quite loose, and many powerful foes keep slipping through the cracks to become problematic later on. More concerning still, the independent daimyo in the east have stopped paying tribute and now are making claims to reclaim Japan from the Toyouji. Even the old Kamakura rulers have survived and grown their influence to expand past Edo and into the surrounding Kanto countryside, becoming a major threat once again.

The doors burst open, and in came over 50 armed mercenaries, surrounding a group of Persian men who marched directly in front of our lord. They stood directly in front of them, offering them a scroll to read. Pouring through it, our lord gasped in shock. They were demanding [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] step down from ruler of the kingdom, and to allow the Persian Families and the other Merchant Guilds take complete control. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] would get an estate in the countryside and a stipend, of course, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] would have no more political power. A Coup D’état. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] carefully looked to the nearby guards, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could tell that some of them were disloyal just from the way sweat began to drip off their foreheads.

 ab_capua.1.t:0 "The Mad Duke of Capua"
 ab_capua.1.d:0 "Robert XI de Hauteville, known by most as the ‘Mad Duke’, wasn’t always the monster that now strikes terror into the hearts of Saracen and subject alike. Though he had always been an eccentric, if not delinquent, character since his childhood, Robert’s insanity and innate cruelty were made manifest during the latter years of his father’s reign. While on an expedition to the Greek-held splinter state of Epirus under orders of the Duke, Robert was intercepted and overpowered by a Sicilian flotilla, and was taken captive for an extended period of time. Unspeakable horrors are presumed to have been endured by the young Norman aristocrat, for he emerged from the dungeons of Naples a broken mockery of his former self. From his experiences were born a deep-seated hatred of all things Saracen, and a murderous intent to match. Transforming the fighting pits his father had constructed into a sizeable amphitheatre, in pale imitation of the Roman style, Robert would offer his people bloodsports and vast displays of the Capuan corsairs’ war trophies in exchange for support in future endeavours. To add further fuel to the fire, Robert had received a “vision” in his last days of imprisonment; one in which he was the true heir to Romulus as Rex of the Romans. Indeed, the Mad Duke now proclaims himself to be the living reincarnation of the legendary founder, struggling against the winds of change to revive the ancient Roman culture and language. Every day, after forcing courtiers to dance and improvise songs to his new lyre compositions, Robert gazes longingly in the direction of the Eternal City. Rome tragically lies in the crusty and geriatric hands of his suzerain, the Pontifex Maximus, but the Rex-to-be seeks to bring about the Return of the King. While most see his claim as nothing more than the ravings of a madman, Robert and his most zealous lackies believe that the Seven Hills are rightfully theirs - for who else but Romulus and his sons can lay claim to them?"

Such spurious claims had caused little concern for the Vatican, who saw Robert as nothing more than a delusional madman. That was, at least, until the Norman warlord abandoned his oath and marched north, scoring a crushing and total victory against the Papal State. Having imprisoned the Pope and College of Cardinals under the threat of a gladiatorial debut, the Mad Duke was hastily sworn in as Rex Romanorum and presented a signet ring presumably belonging to a Roman statesman of old. With the madman actually accomplishing what was assumed to be an impossible feat, many of the rulers across Europe now look on with concern, wondering if, perhaps, Robert isn't quite so erratic as once thought."

Such spurious claims had caused little concern for the Vatican, who saw Robert as nothing more than a delusional madman, and their beliefs were reaffirmed upon his passing. Nonetheless, Capua has managed to twist the ludicrous claims of its most infamous Duke into legitimate reason for war. Casting off the burden of vassalage, the Normans marched to battle and scored the victory of the century; the fall of Rome, into their hands. Having imprisoned the Pope and College of Cardinals under the threat of a gladiatorial debut, a tradition which has lingered since the Mad Duke’s days, the Capuan ruler was presented with a signet ring presumably belonging to a Roman statesman of old.

As it turns out, betraying and invading the Papal States has alienated Capua from the rest of Europe - something which the Mad Duke has failed to take into account. His madness, however, has only played into the reputation as a demon in the shape of a man. In response to his excommunication and condemnation, the Norman warlord has had a great many Cardinals and other clergymen thrown into the Amphitheatre of Capua. Robert XI, Rex Romanorum and Duke of Capua, sees himself as a Neronian artist; cruelty and hedonism without bound litter his kingdom of vices. The house of cards is so precarious that Robert’s fall could bring down everything else around him, but for now he is the king undisputed; respected and saluted. Esoteric madness and eccentricity unchained now slowly turn the grinding wheel..."

 ab_capua.5.d:0 "The capture of Rome and re-establishment of the Regnum has elevated Capua to an unanticipated level of infamy and patronage from all across Europe. Grifters and imbeciles with rich benefactors seeking to ooze their way into the Eternal City flock to her Norman overlords, blindly throwing money and talent at the Hauteville throne in expectance of the favour being returned through political clout. Among these charlatans, however, lie a few genuine souls who seek to make use of Rome’s resources for mutual gain - on a cultural level, at least. These self-described ‘Hellenists’ are well-learned scholars and artisans from the decaying Byzantine Empire, those sleazy imitators of true Roman glory. No doubt, they seek to flee the rampaging Bulgars or, circumstances permitting, merely observe the world from outside the sheltered Constantinopolitan bubble. With the innate interests in Hellenistic teachings and art still lingering in no small part thanks to the Mad Duke’s influence on Capuan court life, it only made sense to grant the brightest among the Hellenists a Royal Commission in exchange for their services. From the bookish, Romano-Capuan learning will accelerate the literacy of the realm, and from the creative shall come a golden age of art and for this soon-to-be marble world! Indeed, this city of timber and brick will be restored to Augustan marble, and Rome shall be reborn once more as the centre of the world!"

Ornately-decorated but incredibly well-armed and swift for a vessel of her class, the new flagship is the envy of all Italy. Duke Robert’s grand vision of restoring the Capuan navy, following a decade of neglect, has finally become a reality. The pride and joy of the Mad Duke, Porco Rosso will have a critical role to play in the Italian naval arms race from this point forward. It is not known what inspired Duke Robert to christen the ship with such a bizarre name, but then again, the inner machinations of his mind are an enigma. Already having her prowess tested in a mock-naval battle against captured Sicilians, the Duke is most impressed by Porco Rosso’s current performance. He is, even now, running around like a giddy child, eagerly anticipating the day when he can lead a real sortie from the Capuan flagship’s bridge. The days when Normans ruled the Mediterranean, the pirates of Capua striking fear into Saracen merchantmen, are no longer a nostalgic memory. Once more, they set sail for war!"

 ab_capua.7.t:0 "No One Like Gaston"
 ab_capua.7.d:0 "Everyone’s favourite guy, nobody comes close to being as admired as Prince Gaston de Hauteville, nephew of the Mad Duke Robert XI. The dashing young rogue awes and inspires everyone he comes across, from the lowest street urchin to the greatest of Europe’s kings, and it’s not very hard to see why. Extremely manly, he is a perfect and pure paragon to all around him. Indeed, as a specimen Gaston is intimidating, for he excels in wrestling matches and no one matches wits like him either. Furthermore, Gaston has a mighty appetite which often puts a strain on his treasury due to the sheer amount of eggs he consumes daily. This has, however, merely strengthened Gaston, as the Capuan prince’s heroic stature makes him roughly the size of a barge. As well as this, Prince Gaston shoots more accurately than even the most skilled German Welsh marksman, so it is only natural for him to be an avid big game hunter. Indeed, the garish tastes of Gaston include a liberal application of antlers in decorating and art, as well as codpieces and form-fitting shirts. While the laughing stock of extremely hypocritical French and German nobility who wear much of the same attire, numerous sculptures of the Prince posing as heroes from Greco-Roman myth are being produced every year. This has become enough of a booming trend, thanks to Gaston, that a brand new romantic art style has been named in his honour; Herculo-Gastonian Neo Romanticism. With all of these accolades under his belt, it is no wonder that Prince Gaston is Duke Robert XI’s favourite, thus also Capua’s heir-presumptive. He also has promising career opportunities in both the army and navy, should he wish to defer rule to one of Robert’s direct line, although even the Mad Duke’s children are less loyal to the Capuan cause than this super success."

 ab_capua.8.d:0 "With the cultural revitalisation of the Italian Peninsula in full swing, even amidst the constant warfare across the known world, a new musical and theatrical innovation has been sweeping the aristocracy into a frenzy over the past several years. This loud, melodramatic, and extravagant mixture of the performing arts is referred to as “Opera”, and already boasts several major hits such as Monteverdi’s “L’Orfeo” and Peri’s “Dafne”. These operatic productions have been observed as a romanticised effort to resurrect the long-forgotten Greek theatre of old, of course with numerous liberties taken for the staging and source material. Among those most impressed by it are the Norma de Hauteville family, notorious for encouraging Mediterranean piracy and providing state-sponsored bloodsports to the unwashed masses. Indeed, a rather cruel and unusual punishment has been undertaken by the Pirate-Kings of the Mediterranean; captured Saracens and merchants are forced to either compose and perform an opera, or fight in the pits. It is of course an absurd fantasy to expect impromptu spectacles of such magnitude from the majority of the Capuan captives, but the alternative is even less enticing than public humiliation to many. The introduction of this theatre of cruelty, or “mockera” to the survivors, has inevitably increased the appeal of such entertainment to the commoners - a genuine desire for theatrical patronage by the ruling family has been put forth via petition. Alas, those who do well in the mockera are now forced to compose and perform state opera to entertain rabble and high nobility alike. Truly a bizarre turn of events on the Italian peninsula."

 ab_capua.9.d:0 " Facing mass-ridicule or near-certain death to appease the bloodthirsty masses in the Capuan hippodrome, a Perso-Turkish merchant in the Hautevilles’ captivity has managed to blow everybody away with a most stunning impromptu mockera performance. Dubbed “Turandokhtar”, or Turandot to the Normans and Turandotta to the Italians, the opera is derived from a number of Middle and Far Eastern influences; from the foothills of Persia to the desolate wastelands of Manchuria. The narrative focuses on a Turkic prince exiled from his homeland, following the Great Yuan’s invasion, who has been struck by love at first sight of the callous yet beautiful daughter of the Khagan. A thoroughly emotive (and likely desperate) performance as the Turkish prince has seen the merchant receive an official pardon from the Norman aristocracy, as well as a standing ovation from the entire audience within the amphitheatre. Perhaps expecting failure, he had collapsed after being overwhelmed by such reception and was ennobled as the Court Dramatist in an equally public display some hours later, evidently from pressure by the arbitrary Lord of Capua. A handwritten copy of the standout aria, Nessun Dorma, has been framed within the royal palace’s Hall of Curiosities, which was established by the Mad Duke himself so long ago. The shockwaves of this improvised masterpiece have torn throughout Europe and the Near East, and now countless Frenchmen, Germans, and even fellow Turks have been attempting to create equally-impactful imitations but to no avail. Nonetheless, Turandokhtar has changed the face of opera forever, and even if his name is forgotten to time, this ex-merchant’s contribution to the cultural zeitgeist of Europe is among the greatest in recent years."

However, his tactical genius and charisma manage to carry the Norman-ruled rump state into constant victories against foes which beset them. It is perhaps for this reason that the Mad Duke hasn’t been deposed and replaced by one of his kinsmen, although things may be taking a turn for the worse. Advisors have witnessed a marked decline in their already cruel and erratic sovereign’s behaviour, with increasingly common bouts of paranoia and eccentricities. During a recent trial of a noble charged with conspiracy to commit regicide, for example, Robert XI’s mood flipped from ire at a supposed traitor, to fearfully accusing the court of siding against him, to sentencing them all to a week of jury duty. Following half an hour of bewildered silence, the Mad Duke promptly declared that the Virgin Mary had scolded him before storming back to his palace. The doors to his chambers had to be broken down following several days without Duke Robert reemerging, with servants fearing the worst, only to see him drawing the plans for a ship-mounted flame projector on a priceless contemporary portrait of Alexios Komnenos, the great Byzantine Emperor. Since then, Robert has been trying to force the Osman & Sons Trading Company representative in Capua to purchase a patent for these scrawlings, but to no avail. In light of how utterly bizarre his recent actions have been, Robert’s chancellor has increased surveillance on the Duke in case he does something irreversibly damaging."

He has just been stopped from attempting to turn a visiting Papal Legate into a human candle, with witnesses claiming the Mad Duke had been singing about Hellfire, Blessed Mary, and something not being his fault while frightening the poor man immensely. After being restrained and calmed down with an alchemical remedy, the Duke appeared to have regained his senses briefly. Alas, this was not meant to be, for Robert XI is now proclaiming that God has ordered an immediate Crusade against Egypt to rescue Alexander the Great from captivity. Courtiers are now frightful that the beginning of the end is nigh, for the Norman warlord is struggling to distinguish reality from his twisted fantasy world."

 ab_capua.12.t:0 "The Lights Dim"
 ab_capua.12.d:0 "Robert de Hauteville, Duke of Capua and 11th of his name, has managed to lapse into an unhinged state for an extended period of time. Problems began when he had received word of foreign agents in the capital, which saw a bloody purge of non-Norman nobility occur when they were thrown to the lions in Capua’s amphitheatre. Robert, in a manic state, was led out of the royal booth under armed escort when a Saracen attempted to run the Mad Duke through with a knife, only to stumble and leave a gaping wound on his target’s waist. It appears that the shock of such an event finally broke the Capuan ruler, for he had been ranting about enemies on all sides for the better part of the ensuing month. Indeed, before locking himself within the Ducal Palace once again, the navy was ordered to bring back one thousand chests of sea shells, much like Caligula. Meanwhile, the army was dispatched to intercept invading forces which never existed outside of the ailing Duke’s imagination, and after returning without having fought a battle, was ordered to swim to the coast of Sicily and establish a military colony atop Mount Stromboli. Suffering an apoplexy upon learning that his soldiers didn’t even accomplish that, Robert threatened to throw everyone to the lions. Robert was then dragged away, after trying to attack the French ambassador, who was struggling to stifle his laughter at the predicament. The Duke has since then been kept under watch, by the orders of his nephew Prince Gaston. In the coming months, provided the Mad Duke’s condition does not improve, the state’s executive powers will be gradually handed over to the privy council. Even with numerous remedies proposed by alchemists, from ice treatment, to mercury tonics, to removing the lead lining from his clothing, Robert’s condition is in rapid decline. The Mad Duke is assumed by many to have reached the point of no return."

Bedridden, deathly pallid, and drenched in a cold sweat, the Mad Duke is barely responding to his attendants. With the privy council in charge of state affairs, Capua’s operations are running smoothly, for the most part. Although the lack of their sovereign’s tactical genius is putting a damper on campaign season, it is probably for the best that the world stand still for a moment longer. There is one thing which alarms the physicians and alchemists more so than the Duke’s downward spiral, however. Each time he lapses back into consciousness, Robert XI has been muttering the chant “Thus Saith The Lord” with little pause. It is unknown what kind of internal battle is raging within Robert’s dreams, but the clergy appear to think that the Duke is being exorcised of a demonic entity. To the more sceptical among the Normal elite, though, all that can be done is wait for the inevitable…"

 ab_capua.14.d:0 "A miracle! Yes, a miracle has occurred! His Highness, Robert XI de Hauteville, Duke of Capua and Rex Romanorum lives! Feared to be terminally ill with an unidentified wasting disease, preparations were hastily made to transfer power to the privy council. The Ducal advisors would then assume control over Capua until a successor could be chosen. However, this seems to prove neither necessary nor welcome. Bursting out of his chambers, stark naked and full of energy, the Mad Duke proceeded to run around the palace grounds proclaiming that he had returned to Earth as a living God. Duke Robert, while never the most stable fellow, claims to be an immortal avatar of the heathen deity Sol Invictus, and wishes for everyone in his realm to know it! Much to the ire of his clerical ministers, Robert now refuses to even acknowledge the presence of others, unless he is addressed as the Unvanquished Sun; the Lord and Bringer of Light. Immediately succeeding his nude parade was issued the official proclamation of the Made Duke’s divinity, and its institution into law. For failing to acknowledge the Norman pirate king as the Bright Lord, Sanctus Robertus Sol Invictus XI de Hauteville, Rex Romanorum et Princeps Senatus, a number of high ranking clergymen and other administrators were lit up in a “Bonfire of Purgatory.” Furthermore, there has been severe retaliation against the “treasonous usurpation” of Robert’s throne. Although an emergency measure undertaken during his near-fatal sickness, it was done without the Mad Duke’s consent. He has thus ordered that everyone involved in the “conspiracy”, save for blood relatives, are to be “purified by the Sun’s healing light”; his lack of clarification has allowed the court officials to be released early by dumbfounded guards and judges unanimously. The Mad Duke’s reign of terror has resumed in full force, with an intense and almost inhuman fervour never before seen. Even Caligula, Nero, and Elagabalus would blush at the utter insanity unfolding before the Capuan people’s very eyes. The self-proclaimed immortal god-duke believes himself unstoppable, invincible, and seeks to spread his word across the Italian Peninsula."

Self-proclaimed Sun God, and immortal God-King of Rome and Capua, Robert XI de Hauteville, is deceased. The Mad Duke was leading a procession through the streets, to consecrate a shrine dedicated to his honour as part of the new sun cult, when a ringing church bell broke loose. The bell brought itself, and the steeple it was suspended in, crashing down onto the paved streets below, causing widespread chaos. The falling bell crushed the Mad Duke on the spot when he failed to react beyond pointing and staring, mouth agape. Alas, the impact of the bell caused the street to collapse, and Robert’s body was swept out to sea through the city’s sewer system. His cadaver was picked up by a Sicilian merchant ship, the crew of which was crucified for attempting to demand ransom for the late Duke’s repatriation. Robert XI de Hauteville now lies in state, following a lengthy bath, although his remains are extremely well-preserved and with minimal signs of the fate which befell him. In fact, the absolute serenity on his face has been compared to that of a statue from the Hellenistic Era and Roman Principate. Most of the faithful Christians within Capua’s sphere believe God himself intervened, striking down the blasphemous tyrant for his excessive hubris and sinful ways. Others, however, would instead argue that the Mad Duke was merely a victim of shoddy construction and maintenance techniques, and may have survived if he had actually stepped out of the way. In any case, the late Robert had dictated a (partially coherent) will, in order to avoid the debacle following his sickness. Those who petitioned him to do so were still fed to the lions, as the Norman lord feared another plot, but now the transition of power can take place without major hiccups. A legacy of insanity and success against the odds survives Robert XI, and it is unlikely that the world will see his likeness ever again. Shine on, you crazy diamond."

That ends on this day, however. A glorious victory greets the eternally-redeemed Italo-Norman forces, marking the latest triumph of the Cross against the Crescent. Through immense feat of arms and a stunning reversal of their situation, the Dukes of Capua can once again claim to be Kings of Trinacria in more than just name. The vile Saracen is driven back, slithering off into its dark hiding place, and surrendering to the Hautevilles their ancestral birthright. Vowing to never again falter against the hordes of enemies which surround them on all sides, the Trinacrian sovereign is heralded by many as the saviour of Latin Christendom. Eternal glory awaits Trinacria, as the resurgent power assumes its rightful seat as hegemon of Southern Italy. Deus Vult!"

 ab_maitreya.1.d:0 "At the dawn of the Red Turban Rebellion, the White Lotus were at the heart of the movement. Subversive activities against the Yuan mixed with a religious fervor helped fuel their revolution along the Yellow River, leading to the eventually collapse of imperial control over the south. Many of the great and powerful warlord states, from Zhou to Song, all give thanks to the White Lotus revolutionaries for weakening and pushing back the Yuan authority. However, their Maitreya teachings were quite radical. Not only did it have heterodoxic elements to its practices and ideology, but it also had a history of violent purges and attacks to bring about the new era promised to them by Maitreyan teachings. Xu Souhui, founder of the Han, brought with him many Maitreya followers, claiming to be the Boddhisatva himself, and that when he died the world would be changed forever. \n \nOf course, when Chen Youliang assassinated him, the world did not transition into a new era, and many of his followers became disillusioned. They instead pivoted to more traditional folk religions, taking over local practices and rituals for themselves. They still remained in power in the Han, but their influence has waned considerably. The current warlord of the Han, [Root.Monarch.GetName], has expressed interest in the group. While their practices are still quite strange and they still have the propensity for violence, their influence is substantial, and their organization is powerful. He needs support in the court, especially as he is surrounded on all fronts by enemies, but to side with the Maitreyans could be risky, as it could court chaos and millenary violence. Still, he makes his choice…"

They clamor for our [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s head, placing the blame upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and her failure to cultivate a society of peace and prosperity. Mobs, made up of warriors and peasants alike, flood the streets, preparing themselves for a revolution. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] meets with advisors, and comes up with the best plan to try and dissuade these radicals."

Whispers abound throughout the palace; there is a plot to remove [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], that’s what the spies said. Gritting [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] teeth, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] began to plan for the best possible outcome. Just as that finished, soldiers burst through the doors, asking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to abdicate and go into the monastic life or be cut down."

However, sometimes these followers are extremely zealous and will lash out, attacking people and places in large scale riots and massacres, all in the hopes of bringing about this new era or believing they are already in it.

To celebrate, there is often a banquet with peaches, plums, and other fruits that remind us of our Wusheng Laomu. This year, celebrations were quite extensive, and some property was even damaged in the wild fun that both man and woman had in the streets of our capital.

 ab_yuan.1.d:0 "Emperor Shaozong, born Sorqaqder, has ruled China for the last thirty four years. As if the dynasty was a reflection of its sickly sovereign, the Great Yuan has just barely held onto parts of Northern China, while the warlords of the south have found generations to become proper states of their own. Externally there is much dissension over how the Yuan should continue to function, as it has been divided into two distinct factions who are nearly ready to wage war against each other. One, a mix of traditionalist Mongols that wish to keep their own power, backed by a Christian and Manichaean Semu whose privileges lend much influence over the Chinese. The Second faction is one which believes the Yuan’s ultimate destiny is that of a proper Chinese state, garnering much support by aiming to end the Yuan’s caste system in full. Like a roof propped up by rotting beams, once Emperor Shaozong dies there shall be no way to prevent things from coming to a head."
 ab_yuan.1.a:0 "May the Emperor Live Ten Thousand Years!"
 ab_yuan.2.t:0 "The Death of Emperor Shaozong"
 ab_yuan.2.d:0 "The inevitable has finally happened; Emperor Shaozong is dead. A Kurultai has been called to discuss who shall succeed the late emperor. The squabbling factions have coalesced around three candidates who each see their way as the only path forward. The primary candidate is Prince Temur, Emperor Shaozong’s son, who sees the Yuan as a proper Mongol successor state. On the other extreme is his rival Prince Dongdin, son of the Jingzong Emperor and a staunch opponent of the caste system, who wishes to transform the Great Yuan into a traditional Chinese dynasty. Separate from the others but preferred by those who believe the state must not face radical change is a Temugid noble by the name of Essen, who traces his lineage back to Temuge, a brother of Genghis Khan. The Kurultai’s decision will shape the future of the Great Yuan, but regardless of whom they choose, a bloody conflict is unavoidable; armed partisans belonging to the three camps have already begun to mobilise, likely fearing the least favourable outcomes for their preferred emperor."

While the dynasty cannot part from the Mandate of Heaven perhaps it should be changed to better suit the dynasty’s needs.

Whether it was to topple Mongol rule, or seize the most glorious mantle of leadership for themselves, it matters little now. After a long and brutal campaign, we have cemented our dominion over the Empire, and destroyed all opposition.

His goal is clear: bring the Yuan in line with the Chinese traditions that have been maintained for millenia by the empires of old. In his eyes, the Yuan are just as Chinese as they are Mongol, and must cultivate this new Chinese culture if it is to thrive into the future. This concept has many detractors across the steppes, and the Khalkha and Korchin Mongols will be ruing this decision for years yet, but one thing is certain: the path is paved for the Yuan, and there is no more turning back."

Often, the gifts were animals - those used in hunting or warfare. However, our dynasty has estblished a tradition of gifting exotic animals, especially caracals and tigers which were often bought from Indian merchants. The value and preciousness of these 'living gifts' was measured through the strength, symbolic value or rarity of the animals which were a key part of diplomatic gift giving. The presence of animals in court ceremonies, royal processions, and later in ruler insignia through different heraldic markings, was, from ancient times, a key part of the manifestations of power and standing of rulers. The inclusion of animals in diplomatic protocol gained a certain political and cultural dimension of mediation between different states and cultures. Since our defeat in the Red Turban Rebellion, there were rarely any delegations coming to the Imperial capital and this tradition was somewhat discontinued. Should we bring it back?"

He explains that by doing so, the people would not see us as their oppressors, but rather as their benign masters, saving us much effort in maintaining order.

Only Novgorod was spared, for its rulers, unlike the others, had the wisdom to surrender. However, due to decades of internal conflicts weakening our grip, the Russians were deluded enough to think they might regain their freedom. Or so they thought. Now, the Rus’ is desolate; the ghosts of its fallen carried on the howling winds. Only ashes linger in this wasteland, and years will pass before any life may re-emerge.

Since that fateful moment, our goal has always been to convert as many people as possible, to give the unbelievers of Asia a chance of entering eternal paradise. Despite how unlikely it had seemed at the time, we have achieved our goal, along with so much more: not only have we brought the word of God to the masses, but we have reestablished our empire in China, something that was thought impossible just a few decades ago. Our nation and our people are servants of God and Christ alone: we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come."

This comes as little surprise to our administration, as rival claimants to the Dragon Throne have been greatly disgruntled ever since we held the disastrous Kurultai. While it was intended to solidify a line of succession, all it did was reduce the clans to a bickering mess. Unfortunately, with the imperial administration's hands tied with red tape and prior domestic troubles, these treasonous worms have been able to quickly seize control of the provincial capital and muster a sizeable host. Even with everything collapsing around us, and the army in disarray, it would be most prudent to throw whatever we can at these pretenders, lest they spread across the region and popular support swings to their favour."

 ab_yuandisaster.4.d:0 "In light of the heavy resistance against our great emperor Temur's rightful claim to the Dragon Throne, many of the Jurchen and Mongolic clans have been forced to make a stand in the conflict within Great Yuan's borders. Far too many have joined the side of our foes, actively trying to oppose Yuan's hegemony, however more still come clamouring to our faction. In particular, Mongol chiefs and civilised Jurchens have proclaimed their recognition - in perpetuity - of Temur's legitimacy as the Son of Heaven, and as the rightful holder of the Mandate of Heaven. Whether this is merely due to our proximity to their own territory, or perhaps stems from shared ideals of a traditional Mongol Empire, we cannot say. At the very least, this affirmation of our sovereignty over most of the tribes is surely a sign from above that we bear the sole right to rule!"

 ab_yuandisaster.5.d:0 "The Duke of Shun is a consistent thorn in our side; questionable loyalties aside, he is an utter drain on resources just to keep in check. With the Han warlords attempting to provoke our subjects in the south into rebelling, it appears that the Duke has finally made his move, and intends to secede entirely from the Great Yuan's sphere of influence. Having revealed his true allegiance, it is now imperative that we destroy his forces, pacify the region, and ensure the traitor's head is mounted on a pike in Khanbaliq. Should we fail, the precedent of Shun's victory could prove catastrophic across all territories of the Great Mongol State."

 ab_yuandisaster.6.d:0 "In order to maintain a standing army which is sufficiently equipped and trained, it has proven necessary to raise taxes by a particularly unpopular amount. While it was expected that the army could maintain security throughout our territories, it has become clear that most of the funding had been siphoned off by officers, with the countryside's stability being neglected entirely. Now that the domestic situation has turned into an unmitigated disaster, with rebellions springing up across numerous provinces, it would appear that the peasantry have grown tired of frequent overtaxation - especially with no results to show for it. As much as it pains us to crack the whip and bring down the fist, we must make an example of the seditious rabble which has sprung up. The message shall be made vivid enough for all to comprehend: dissent shall be swiftly, and brutally, crushed. After, and only after, the present crisis has been resolved, shall the administration consider cutting back taxes."

 ab_yuandisaster.7.d:0 "While many of our Mongol subjects have remained loyal, there are those who would see the Great Yuan destroyed and purged from living memory. Such a faction has recently spread like wildfire amongst the Mongolian uluses, and has presented itself as one of the most significant threats to the empire's integrity which we have faced thus far. This so-called "Great Mongol Revolt", while utterly unjust in its demands and unlawful in its cause, has sadly managed to unite a vast host of disgruntled clans under its banner, and intends to reforge the legacy of the Great Khan on its own terms. If we, the true successors to Kublai and Genghis, are to survive the storm raging above our heads, we must react quickly and with utmost ruthlessness."

 ab_yuandisaster.8.d:0 "Prince Nayan's revolt had failed to establish the traditionalist faction as sole rulers of the then-sprawling Mongol Empire, however the treacherous runt nonetheless succeeded in felling the great Kublai Khan. As a consequence of the Temugid prince's partial victory, the Nestorian faith which Nayan so fervently subscribed to had firmly entrenched itself within his little appanage ulus of Kwan-ning, even after his assassination and official condemnation as a traitor. Evidently hoping to capitalise on the strong anti-Yuan sentiments of recent times, Nestorians under the wing of a minor Temugid noble have taken to championing their Christian, anti-Sinophilic cause in a radical manner. Refusing to budge from their stance when offered the olive branch by our negotiators, their stated aim is to purge the Great Yuan's current regime and ruling class in favour of their own, having declared a Great Eastern Crusade which shall see a Heavenly Kingdom rise from the ashes. These neurotic zealots must be put down, or we will have a most dreadful bloodbath on our hands."

 ab_yuandisaster.9.d:0 "The brutish mongrel, Temur, is a walking fossil, having demanded a full-blown return to the 'old ways' for years. His backwardsness is unrivalled in all the world, but the dream of returning to the steppe appears to have seduced numerous Mongol clans to the traditionalist cause. Unfortunately for us, paired with the strong alienation these nomads feel, such ephemeral desires have culminated in open revolt. As their first move, evidently an attempt to dislodge Yuan rule in the western provinces, Temur's loyalists have successfully seized control of the administrative heart of the Mongol uluses. Indeed, Qaraqorum fell with little resistance, as it would appear the garrison, too, believed treason to be a rewarding avenue. With the loss of our grip over the region, forces must be dispatched immediately, lest our mandate be further questioned - and thus usurped. Qaraqorum must be reclaimed, and the rebels driven deep into Siberia's boundless wastes."

 ab_yuandisaster.10.d:0 "As to be expected from our effeminate, and ever-scheming subjects in China-proper, the malcontents have refused to even acknowledge their rightful liege - Essen Temugid - as emperor! This outrageous and petulant act of high treason comes not only as an insult to the sovereign, but also to the Lord Tengri himself! Spitting on the One True God's holy icon, within Khanbaliq's chapel, disloyal Chinese noblemen proceeded to violate the hallowed ground, cursing Essen Khagan's name all the while. While the Christian faith would have inevitably alienated a significant portion of the Chinese, and to a lesser extent Mongol, populace, such indignation was wholly unanticipated by the compromise faction. If Yuan is to survive the coming waves of unrest and bloodshed, amidst this already-costly civil war, the Nestorian Church of the East must quickly prove itself capable of securing the empire. Should Christendom fail in this feat, they will be the first on the chopping block once the dust settles."

 ab_latin.1.t:0 "Fall of Constantinople"
 ab_latin.1.d:0 "The Angelos dynasty had ruled the Eastern Roman Empire complacently for many years, assuming that the failure of the Venetians to seize Constantinople marked the final effort. They were, as always, proven dead wrong recently. What was once thought impossible has now been made a reality; the City of the World’s desire has fallen. Latin troops bearing the Cross breached the Theodosian Walls and overwhelmed the defending garrison, fuelled by what the scant few survivors thought to be a hellish furor. A carnival of looting and pillaging ensued, with nothing spared. Everywhere the Latins went, bloodshed followed. Not even the civilians or imperial mausoleum were spared from the massacre. Constantinople has been brought to its lowest point in Byzantine history, with not even the Justinian Plague’s body count comparable. With Latins in control of the city, there are few doubts in anybody’s mind that the final death of Byzantium is upon us."

 ab_latin.2.d:0 "On this day, the Catholic world rejoices. For the longest time, it has been one of Catholicism’s dreams to unite the Christian world, and in doing so prove that it is the one true Church. Though Constantinople is barely a shadow of its former self, it shall regardless serve as the capital of the new state which has emerged from the ashes. The Latin Empire, Christendom’s first line of defence in Eastern Europe, is now the torchbearer. With the Byzantines resigned to memory and the Orthodox Church violently shaken, many now look to this new state as the latest source of hope. Of course, not everything is well in paradise. The Latin ruling class are at best a minority group within the Empire, greatly outnumbered by Greeks, Slavs, and Turks, and many bear ill will over Venice’s failed invasion in 1204. Furthermore, there are still those who stubbornly cling onto the Orthodox faith, though it is only a matter of time until they are rooted out or brought into the light. Whatever the future may have in store, one thing is certain: this is likely the dawn of a new era in the Old World. May the Latin Empire bring about eternal peace and prosperity for her friends, and the wrath of God upon her foes."

Indeed, the Latin Patriarchate of Alexandria especially never existed as anything more than a ceremonial position. Although the Holy See granted Bishops this title, not one of them ever sat in their designated Patriarchate; Rome would house these bishops instead. With the fall of the Nizzarid heathens, who had refused the Catholic Church’s legitimate, well-balanced request to oust the Orthodox and Miaphysite heretics, we can now install a Latin Patriarch loyal to the Vicar of Christ. The Nile belongs to the Legions of the Cross for the first time since the reign of Heraclius. Henceforth, Egypt’s future shall be a Latin one."

In order to show our appreciation for their truly outstanding support, it has been suggested that we allow them full control over the Venetian Quarter, and even the Merchant districts at large. They would be completely separate from the Latin administration, which will no doubt score the ire of our own people, but we will also receive a great deal of commerce and trade taxes - no doubt! The Lord of One Fourth and One Half of the Empire, as the title shall be styled, might just give Constantinople that extra push to help restore her to the glory days before our admittedly rather cruel takeover. All that’s left is the Emperor’s signature, and the office will be established."

As the seat of the Kings of Jerusalem since the First Crusade, the constant threat of Islamic takeovers haven’t harmed the population of this fortress-city as they did with other regions of the Holy Land, at least as significantly. With the Empire’s banners flying from the walls and a large boost to morale, it will only be a matter of time until the rest of the Near East returns to the Christian fold. The Emperor, with the Pope’s blessing, has promised to continue the reconquest of former Christian lands until not a single heathen holds rule over the Old World, much to the fanfare of the Catholics. It seems that peace won’t return to the region for some time, though many are holding onto hope for Latin unification to change this perpetually."

 ab_latin.6.d:0 "The most venerable Alexandria returns to the fold, having been under the Islamic fist for far too long. The Latin Empire’s forces sacked the city after breaching the walls, perhaps spurred on by the sheer amount of Hellenistic remnants still dominating several districts, though with far less carnage than Constantinople’s fall. Artefacts were pocketed, larger treasures were pulled from their fittings and sent back to Constantinople, and the Sultan’s palace put to the torch. Even the prominent Soma, Alexander the Great’s tomb, was desecrated by zealous Latins seeking a little fame, but his remains were nowhere to be found; evacuated to safety by the Coptic community according to rumours. As the chaos dies down and order is once more restored, the Empire’s forces turn their gaze to lands beyond the horizon. For the glory of God!"

Already, swarms of the faithful have flocked to Constantinople in the hopes of securing a place in Heaven and forgiveness for all their sins in life, with the added bonus of taking some Saracens down with them. The drums of war beat louder than ever before, and many fear that the Latins - still high off their victory against Byzantium - can be easily stirred into a rabid frenzy from which little more than disaster may follow. Those concerned also mention that the supposed call to arms by the Pope is dubious at best, and most likely forged by one of the Emperor’s agents. Either way, nothing has come from the Holy See to confirm or deny such claims and the many skeptics find themselves lynched or chased into hiding by mobs of riled up glory-seekers. The cries for peace from the meek and otherwise non-militant Christians are now drowned out by church bells and chanting, their pleas falling on eyes and ears closed to all but the will of God. Latin armies amass in preparation for a grand campaign, one which may take multiple generations and span half a continent.

The issue lies in who will claim this lofty position, for many distinguished warriors of noble blood have made their mark under the Banner of the Cross. Especially important to consider is that several of them hold direct blood ties to the Crusader Kingdoms of the Holy Land.

With guilt-laden memories of the razing at Medina still crushing his heart and mind with its sheer weight, the Emperor of the Latins knew what he had to do. Grant new purpose, a second life, to the city of Mecca and her people. It may not secure his place in Heaven, for what good is an act of Charitas if preceded by acts of Ira numbering in perhaps the millions? Nonetheless, he set his plans in motion. In the honour of Saint Baldwin the Great, the hero-king who single-handedly saved Jerusalem from the incursions of Saladin, Mecca shall be reborn. A final mark upon the world by the Latin Empire’s Last Crusade, one which has incurred many mixed responses from all corners of the known world. Many are livid at the blatant idolatry and cult of personality, and yet others are nonetheless relieved to know that the Latins’ inhuman viciousness and zealotry may have finally been tempered. The Last Crusade, for all the pain it has wrought, is now at an end. The world will never be the same and the countless injuries inflicted can never fully heal, though in time old wounds may yet scar over. May God forevermore preserve us from the shafts of war."

The most well-known, at least amongst Latin circles, is that this false pretender to the true Imperium Romanum is a fundamental failure on every conceivable level. Ill-managed by German barbarians falsely claiming to be civilised, and polluted to its very core by adoration of the Antichrist as well as every sin and vice imaginable, the Emperor and Pope have both agreed that something must be done. This mutilated, bloated corpse of Charlemagne’s true Catholic realm is an affront to God and all good Christians of the world, thus it must be destroyed - no matter the cost. While the Latin people may be hesitant about striking down fellow Christians, they must understand that it is for the good of all that is Holy. When, and only when, the Latin Empire stands triumphant atop the carcasses of the Prince-Electors and Emperor of All Evils, may Europe see itself free from tyranny. While even the French, our countrymen, are denouncing this divine cause as “insane” and “inherently un-Christian”, this only shows that the False Empire’s roots are spread further than the unpious expect.

Its capture has been a critical objective of the Latin Empire’s “Last Crusade” right from the start, with special plans drawn up regarding its fate post-invasion. If anything is to be said, none could have possibly comprehended the sheer cruelty and hatred sweeping through every street and corner from the moment the defences were breached. Little remains, to the point where even the Emperor was rumoured to have collapsed from revulsion and guilt at the sight. No Christian warrior left the ruins with their innocence intact, with many not even retaining their sanity. His Holiness’ Papal Emissary has utterly decried the barbarism in a scathing report sent to the Holy See, denouncing the Latin forces as a horde of beasts to which the Saracen cannot ever hope to compare. With word of the Enlightened City’s harrying spreading like wildfire across the known world, even Christians - often hostile towards their Muslim counterparts - have united in protest against the Latin Empire’s cruelty. It seems that, despite supposedly carrying out the will of God, salvation is something which the Latins may never receive."

 ab_latin.12.d:0 "Considered to be one of the beacons of Islam in the West, the great city of Cordoba demonstrated time and again to be a breeding ground of malicious intent against the Righteous Crusade of the Latins. The Umayyad Dynasty is no stranger to putting Christendom into a stranglehold, as demonstrated with their cruel victory at Valencia so many years ago. With the inevitable encroachment of the Cross, though, the heathens’ hopes for victory have been dashed. Islam’s throat now finds a dagger plunged deep within, as the Latin Empire walks away with entire caravans of plunder; countless artefacts and treasures shipping back to Jerusalem. The city, deprived of its splendour for the first time in history, may soon be doomed to lie in everlasting decay; a fate embodied by the still-smouldering husk of the Great Mosque of Cordoba. The Catholic world, albeit horrified by the unspeakable brutality demonstrated by the Latins, still rejoices at the death-blow dealt to one of its most dogged foes. Andalusia likely won’t last much longer if the Latin Empire keeps up the offensive, though should they grow complacent and fail to press the advantage, it may eventually be Jerusalem under Muslim occupation instead."

One way in which we could try and endear the people - or at the very least those who matter: merchants, bureaucrats, and landed nobility - is to re-establish the Byzantine court traditions. While disgustingly decadent and overcomplicated, if we were to add a Latin touch to things, the Empire would probably benefit from a smoother cultural transition. Of course, we can always establish a full-blown feudal court system, but there would likely be overwhelming hostility from all within Constantinople as well as a high chance of insurrection. Those stubborn Greeks, if anything, do care about their heritage…"

Readily defeating the Saracens time and again, he was the only man known to have beaten the great heathen Saladin in battle. His popularity was so great that the Christians of the Holy Land took to demanding that he become a household saint, and yet the Catholic Church has done nothing to canonise this great man. With the Faithful’s grip over Rome as secure as we could hope, there is little shock at the mention that His Holiness the Pope may be “convinced” to see to Baldwin the Great’s elevation of status. After all, he was the one responsible for Christianity’s survival in the Near East even well after his death. What better way to honour such a great role model than this?"

As the walls of Constantinople shattered beneath the blows of our war machines, our men poured forth, engulfing the desperate garrisons. The ensuing bloodshed soon consumed the entire city. At some point, our Shtitonostzi broke free from their ranks to pursue a burgeoning melee in the Sacred Palace, the abandoned home of Constantine I himself. The decrepit building soon found itself alight, be it by sabotage or circumstance and the resulting flames consumed half of the city, as if Constantine's sadness and subsequent malice had rained down from the heavens to punish his decadent descendants. Miraculously, the Hagia Sophia was unharmed, despite its adjacency to the Sacred Palace. Not only has the garrison been wholly annihilated, but so has the city's approximate population of 50,000 assorted Greeks. Thousands have fled and many more have been slain. With the city's administrative and noble population thoroughly destroyed, Boyar men and scores of Bulgar peasants have swept through the streets, claiming property and new governmental positions alike, thoroughly and irreversibly changing the city's demographics. Given the newfound proliferation of the Bulgar tongue in and around the city, as well as along the freshly-secured trade routes, Constantinople has been unofficially and colloquially branded with a new name, far-removed from the language prior - Tsarigrad."

Outsiders have historically run diplomatic and technological circles around our humble kingdoms, picking at our traditions, native faiths and ways of life until we were mere cannibalized shells of peoples; bullied diplomatically and economically in order to ward off our 'primitive wrath' and gradually changed into new cultures and countries entirely, swallowed up and integrated into the Orthodox world. This need not be grim, however. We were always a mighty and cunning people. We might have been behind the times and outmatched technologically, but this is true no longer. The Southern Slavs now find themselves united beneath a common banner. Free from the oppressive outsiders, our burgeoning empire finds newfound respect in the eyes of its neighbors.

However - one claim shines in a sea of the lost and embittered. One claim stands tall, towering over the ancient forests of Eastern Europe, looming over every petty lord's palace and humble hillfort. From our bustling and proud capital, a song is sung - that of a new Rome, a Third Rome, a Rome triumphant and reborn. A Rome of Christ, an Orthodox and true Christ at that, seeking to unify, envelop and protect the Orthodox world in its totality.

The city was the seat of power for the Zoroastrian Iranians for centuries, and if we are to claim that legacy, we must showcase it with great works and projects.

We must be wary of these gods and remove them from our realm; it is the duty of the Shah to do so. None are more destructive to us than that of Islam, that which had threatened our lively hood and very nearly came close to wiping out the ancient tradition. We must remove all traces of this faith, starting with their most holy of sites, Mecca and Medina.

Despite Rome proper's collapse and ruin, a rump state persisted in clinging to the Mediterranean's eastern extent and thus we became embroiled as bystanders in its troubled history. They were evidently not made for this world - for they have slowly haemorrhaged power, holdings and wealth until they were reduced to their capital and insignificant remnants scattered across the Aegean. \n\n Constantinople now lays in our hands - the final bastion of Roman civilisation. Our men, tired from the countless months spent besieging the city, have laid waste to its timeless foundations. Palaces lay burning and once-booming markets are alight with wild flames.

With a nation established proper and true, we proclaim anew the land of Gothia - a homeland for all Goths, a kingdom of the Germanic tongue, countless provinces and holdings carved out by honour, sacrifice and glory. Our people, from the most humble of peasantry to the most dignified nobility, are experiencing a surge not only in national pride, but national resolve - for further conquests, greater exploits, surely await us, with our fearsome borders ready to swell to even greater extents, ready to rival and eclipse that of the Gothic empires of old."

We have reclaimed the north and with it, the ancient city of Ravenna. Europa balked before at our newfound extent, our resurgent triumph - now, it must accept the Italian peninsula's return to the Gothic fold. Already, nobles, scholars and administrators alike clamour for us to proclaim Ravenna our new capital, to ensure greater ease in consolidating the peninsula and replicating Theodoric's legacy.

Many centuries ago, the Visigoths of old carved out a mighty kingdom across the peninsula, sparing the humble tribes and settlers within from Roman catastrophe and mismanagement. Decadence and internal struggles, however, allowed calamity to take place - the accursed Umayyads swept through the Maghreb and exploited the troubles of our ancestors, brushing aside the crumbling kingdom in their relentless century of conquest. \n\n With our newfound strength, we have dealt the Muslims a crushing blow in securing Iberia for ourselves once more. Already, the inhabitants of the peninsula are coming out in droves, eager to accept our tried and tested ways, follow our kind laws and heed our wise and ancient culture.

 ab_byzantium.9.d:0 "The Roman Empire is but a mere shell of its former self, a shadow of the glorious state that once stretched across the Mediterranean. While there is no one single cause for the collapse of the Empire, there is one family that keeps pushing the empire closer and closer towards total destruction, albeit unintentionally. The Angelos dynasty, which has been ruling over Byzantium since the 12th Century, have showcased the military incompetence, corruption, overspending, and a complete disregard for state maintenance that the Byzantine Empire has come to be known for.\n\nWhen they sent the general Leon Gabras to defeat the Turkish invaders, the general betrayed them and established the Nicene kingdom across the Bosporus. Leon was but an example of the nobility acting against the interests of the state; the nobility has fallen into decadence, accepting bribes while hosting lavish parties, all while enemies press their feet harder on the Empire’s throat. And yet, the Angelos have made little attempt to try and curb this rampant corruption. When Emperor Andronikos attempted to push back against the Bulgars with the aid of the Serbs, they never actually joined forces and instead were picked off one by one. Not only did the humiliating peace treaty bisect the empire with the loss of Thessaloniki, but it also enforced the burden of war reparations upon the Angelos. If Byzantium is to survive the centuries to coming, they must rebuild their broken state, reform their military, and prevent further incursions from rivals, lest they fall just as the west did."

It took the cooperation of multiple noble houses to facilitate this rapid rebirth of the Byzantine state, some of whom aspired to take the crown for themselves.\n \n The house of laskaris, Komnenos, Doukas, and several others all eye the throne for their own and are debating the merits of an overthrowing of the Angelos. Now would be the opportune time; should these factions seek to take down the Angelos, they could do so in the name of reform and progress, and the rest of the ruling elite would accept them as the new Emperors. However, some doubt the plan; the Angelos are now more powerful than they have ever been before. With the reformed army and court behind them, they will not only bring prosperity to the Empire, but they would also be incredibly difficult to overthrow.

The bastard descendants of that Gabras traitor have cowardly struck at our moment of weakness and sent us a message; surrender Smyrna or prepare for war. How should we respond? Of course, we should rush to defend our rightful territory, but on the other hand, maybe we should let this one go, our situation isn’t exactly geared for war at the moment."
 ab_byzantium.34.a:0 "We can’t hope to defend the city"

 ab_byzantium.35.d:0 "As expected, the cowardly Romans have ceded their city. But we shouldn’t rest yet, there is no doubt they are scheming as we speak to return Smyrna to their dominion, we must prepare for conflict in the near future, lest they strike first."

 ab_byzantium.36.d:0 "Maybe the Corpse-Empire still has some spine after all. It is regrettable to say, but the Emperor has refused our generous offer. Our forces have amassed in the mountains outside the city, and our agents await their orders. All that remains now, is to give the order to advance my liege."

 ab_byzantium.37.d:0 "Nicaea calls for our aid! As their allies, it would only be appropriate to receive their call to arms and mobilize our forces against the Romans, but this might not be in our best interest. However, if we do refuse, the Nicene’s certainly won’t appreciate it."

 ab_byzantium.39.t:0 "Guns of Urban"
 ab_byzantium.39.d:0 "Being at a crossroads between civilizations, our ailing empire has always been partial towards stumbling upon strange goods from faraway lands. As of late, a new oddity has swept through the local trade hubs - advanced artillery weapons, some of which can fit within the palm of one's hand, originating from a most distant eastern kingdom of 'Goryeo'. While these foreign treasures mostly consist of childish trinkets and indecipherable designs scrawled in strange characters, the Osman and Sons Trading Company have partnered with a Magyar siege weapon expert, Orbán, to construct for us the most useful of these aberrances. The first are a series of arrow-slinging wagons, 'Hwacha', which utilise the power of gunpowder to propel arrows to lethal, monstrous speeds. Said 'Hwacha' can be made even more fearsome, by loading them with a horror unlike anything seen in Europa - 'divine machine arrows', 'Singijeon', arrows which explode on contact, as if they were cannonballs. In addition, Orban is an expert in cannon warfare and claims he can build for us gigantic cannons that can blast 'the walls of Babylon itself'. Should we pay the daunting sum for their construction, these horrors could give us an unholy edge over our neighbours and make of our fallen empire a resurgent phoenix."
 ab_byzantium.39.a:0 "We will use it to destroy our enemies!"

 ab_byzantium.40.t:0 "Guns of Urban"
 ab_byzantium.40.d:0 "A Magyar engineer by the name of Orban has come to us with an interesting proposal. Partnered with the Osman and Sons Trading Company, he has compiled a series of designs for advanced artillery weapons, big and small- including, effectively, the largest cannons Europe has yet seen and bizarre wooden machines, 'Hwacha', capable of launching dozens of exploding arrows, 'Singijeon', at horrific speeds, exploiting the darkest arts of warfare possible via gunpowder. Exactly how they've procured such nefarious ideas, we are not sure, but we hear they hail from the mysterious eastern kingdom of 'Goryeo', where devilish heathen men launch fire from their palms and cannonballs from mere muskets. Our spies and merchants indicate that Orban unsuccessfully offered his services to the Byzantine rump state before coming to us, so perhaps it is best to secure this technology now before it proliferates elsewhere."
 ab_byzantium.40.a:0 "With these weapons, entire kingdoms will fall at our feet"

 ab_byzantium.42.d:0 "As our political situation worsens, we are barely able to maintain peace within their own Military. Each general with an inkling of ambition are watching the success of the Gabras in Nicaea and they are beginning to develop some nefarious goals of their own. If we were to let them loose, let our generals roam foreign lands away from Constantinople, we could face a rebellion from within our own ranks. We have to keep them nearby, with a firm leash around their neck, at least until this crisis is over."

 ab_byzantium.43.d:0 "Our treacherous nobles who only care about their own interest are seeking every opportunity to further sabotage and undermine the power of the Roman throne, especially in the disastrous situation we currently face. The imperial palace has received a letter with an ultimatum from the most powerful nobles of the realm; increase the rights of the nobility and give them more land, or face an open rebellion. What is our answer?"

 ab_byzantium.44.t:0 "Urban's Movable Cannon"
 ab_byzantium.44.d:0 "Our recent triumphant victory has proven that Orbán is not a charlatan, but a true master of siege weaponry and cannon warfare. While we were waging war on the battlefield, Master Orbán was working on his improved version of the cannon. Recently, he has requested an audience with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself, offering even more effective and deadly siege weaponry, but to turn his prototype into a weapon, a large investment will be required."

 ab_byzantium.45.d:0 "Under Angelid dominion, the Eastern Roman Empire has suffered more in the span of two centuries than could have been thought possible. The former titan of the Near East is now a decrepit, failed state with little prospect for a future. At least, that is what most of Constantinople's subjects believe to be the case. Ever since the rise of the illegitimate Nicene Kingdom, under the treasonous bloodline of Leon Gabras, many so-called Greeks have revealed their true colours to our great state, and are fleeing in droves across the Hellespont. Although these fork-tongued villains claim it is to seek security, stability, and a better life in the more stable half of the Greek world, our infallible Basileus sees through such falsehoods. Evidently, such subversive agents cannot appreciate the safety of Rome's civilised barriers; Bulgaria's illegal foray into Macedonia was a mere fluke, and the Nicene state is surely to fall within a matter of months. So what if the countryside's living conditions are comparable to those of the West after Alaric's rampage through Italy? So what if Constantinople's population has dwindled to a meagre 18,000 in under a century? The situation is completely under control, and these vermin are failing to fathom our sustained prosperity by seeking to betray us for thirty pieces of silver and a farm on the Anatolian coast. And besides, even if they were to leave, we're in control of the ferries. What's the worst that could happen should these serfs be turned back? A disgruntled population? Rome's brave legions will surely be a match for them! Surely..."

 ab_byzantium.45.b:0 "Turn them back. Break a few eggs if you have to."
 ab_byzantium.46.t:0 "Ignoring Our Debts"
 ab_byzantium.46.d:0 "The Angelid family's irresponsible and profligate spending habits are no secret to the court, or to the people of the Empire. In order to fund extravagant parties and degenerate gatherings whilst the realm burnt, they first blew through centuries of gold coinage saved up in the treasury. Once enough gold to secure the loyalty of Attila the Hun thrice over was wasted, they then turned to the banks. Once the banks were drained and packed up to rebuild in Nicaea, it was the merchants' turn. Now that only Osman & Sons is able to afford its own survival, our wise and restrained Basileus has turned to begging - and even threatening - his own nobles and advisors for additional funds. While a small payout once in a blue moon was seen as a tolerable sacrifice to most, the line has now been crossed to these patient courtiers. Ostensibly a gift for his neice, the Basileus has wasted a disgustingly large pile of gold to pay for ancient treasures sold by his house's kindred spirit; that wicked King of the Franks, Lothair III, God take his soul. Lothair had of course run into his own spot of financial trouble, destroying Francia's economy in under a year to support his spending habits, but unlike our own sovereign, had instead turned to selling off his ancestral heirlooms - from sceptres and circlets, to tapestries and marble sculptures. Alas, the money which the Basileus spent is suspected to have been what he had extorted from his inner circle just weeks prior, and the irate Council has submitted a foreboding ultimatum: either the Basileus repay them in full, with interest, or they depart for Nicaea before sunset. Backed into a corner, the toothless lion must sacrifice one limb to save another."

 ab_ghorde.1.d:0 "Ever since the inception of our wing of the Mongol Empire, the Golden Horde has been subject to a number of problems. Chief among these, the structure of the nomadic army has resulted in countless failures, the central authority of the Horde has waned over time with crisis after crisis, and the court is filled with constant feuds over succession and rulership. If the Golden Horde is to survive, there must be serious reform and renewal within the empire, for it is in no state to continue."
 ab_ghorde.1.a:0 "Dark times lie ahead"
 ab_ghorde.2.t:0 "A Rival Contests the Throne"
 ab_ghorde.2.d:0 "The succession of the Golden Horde has always been a messy affair, with various Khans holding equal if not more power than the Khan of the Golden Horde. As our empire unravels, and $HEIR$ ascends to the throne, one of his Borjigin relatives has challenged his rule, and laid claim to the Golden Horde for himself!"

 ab_ghorde.3.t:0 "The Crimean Rebellion"
 ab_ghorde.3.d:0 "Crimea has never been one of the most loyal areas of the empire. The southernmost reaches remain in the hands of the princes of Gothia, closely allied with the Romans. However, the Tatars that occupy the rest of Crimea chose to permanently tie themselves to the land during our conquests and have since embraced the teaching of Christ, adopting their own trappings. With the apparent decline of our own empire, however, one bold prince has chosen to crown himself Khan of Crimea, effectively declaring independence."

 ab_ghorde.4.t:0 "The Nogai Khan Defects"
 ab_ghorde.4.d:0 "The domain once ruled by the infamous kingmaker Nogai Khan remains a very important crossroads in the empire, connecting it to Asia for trade and conquest. While the Tatars here remain largely similar to our own way of life, the people that call this area home have always tended to rally behind descendants of Nogai Khan, as well as the cause of Buddhism. Seeing the power of the Golden Horde eroding, a descendant of Nogai Khan has rallied several ulus under his banner and declared the independence of the Nogai Khanate."
 ab_ghorde.4.a:0 "We must crush the descendants of Nogai here and now!"

 ab_ghorde.5.t:0 "The Rise of Kazan"
 ab_ghorde.5.d:0 "When the armies of the Mongol Empire swept through the western steppe, they trampled what remained of the powerful emirs of Volga Bulgaria. Devout followers of Islam well before the invasion, the Turkic Bulgars have remained nominally loyal subjects to the Golden Horde, their identities intertwined with those of the other Tatars as their new identity crystallised. As the Golden Horde begins to unravel, several princes among the Volga Tatars have come to question the wisdom of standing by the Khan. One prince, the ruler of Kazan, has taken a stand with the support of other muslim princes, dubbing himself the Khan of Kazan and raising a sizable army."

 ab_ghorde.9.d:0 "With the worst of our succession troubles finally behind us, the Golden Horde stands at a crossroads. For many in the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and those across the realm, the near collapse of the Empire is a clear sign that change must come to our way of life. Many intellectuals at court and emissaries from our remaining subjects point to the various advancements in Europe as an example to follow. For others in court and abroad, however, it is a sign that the Golden Horde must be revitalized and made to ride and conquer like the nomads who established it. Whichever path [Root.Monarch.GetName] decides to walk down, it is sure to define our future for many generations to come."

 ab_ghorde.10.d:0 "Even before the we came to rule these lands, many faiths clashed on the steppe, gaining their own followers and challenges. With our recent conquest and generations of rule, the Muslims of the Volga have been allowed to flourish and grow, Christian missions have frequented the ports of the Crimea, and several rulers of the empire have invited Buddhists to settle in our important cities and some of the more eastern regions of our domain. With recent troubles seeming to have finally been put behind us, some within the Khan’s court have begun to discuss formally adopting a more settled faith in order to facilitate better relations with our neighbors moving forward."

 ab_nicaea.3.d:0 "Eager to avenge the legendary betrayal of the crusaders, our troops spared no-one as they descended upon the once-great city of Venice. The mission of the imperial generals has always been clear, all patrician families must be stripped of their property and honors, and the treasures that were once stolen from the city of the worlds desire must be returned. As the time came for the descent of Greek armies upon the City of Water, things turned more hideous than anyone could have imagined. A lifetime of warfare does not foster kindness in anyone and with commanders eager to see the city burn, our soldiers embarked on a several days long campaign of devastation and plunder of churches, palaces and even the Venetian arsenal."

 ab_nicaea.4.d:0 "Nearly three centuries ago, Greece suffered possibly the most devastating defeat in modern times at the hands of the Turkish hordes – The Battle of Manzikert. Greek soldiers led by Roman fools were slain by Seljuk forces, paving the way for the Turkish conquest of Anatolia. As our legions march across the fields where so many of our ancestors lost their lives, they break ranks and erect a monument to those who were lost.

Former temples lay in ruins, and the mighty pyramids themselves have lost their limestone shine, for the Romans, and later Arabs, have ruled these lands for centuries, until now.

While it might seem simple at first, the capital of any nation is a difficult issue, being the center of all activity in the realm, and the seat of the administration. Choosing an ample place is of utmost importance, and as our territory expands, Nicaea becomes less and less advantageous.

Yet, no matter how much we try and how much we spit on the legacy of this horrendous Empire our rage is not satiated. It is impossible to state all the crimes of Rome against Hellas, but the worst of them is how much they indoctrinated Greeks into the idea of Roman identity. As time goes by we find more and more radical solutions to the Latin disease but it never seems to be enough, not enough to make our ancestors truly smile upon a purified Greece. \n \n However, for the last few years there has been a growing radical clique in our court, one whose ideas are considered insane by many; they suggest we completely cut ourselves off from Christianity and restore the Hellenic pantheon of old. And after all, wasn't it Rome that wiped out the Hellenic temples and replaced them with churches and cathedrals? \n \n The clique is very insignificant and struggles to gain support with even the most radical anti Roman parts of society, yet a single word from our King could change all that - we could give them the resources and authority to conduct such a reform of Greek faith. It might be extremely destabilizing and costly, but at the end of the day, our redemption from Rome is surely a priceless goal."

 ab_georgia.1.d:0 "With the isolate Kingdom of Georgia overwhelmed by steppe peoples, Seljuqs and marauding heathens, the Georgian cultural spirit has splintered and crumbled. Much like the Roman Empire of old and the troubled Franks, a good king can prolong the unity of his holdings- but successive ill-gotten rulers will reduce not only a kingdom to ash, but erode the very memory and notion of it over time. Thus, no longer do the hardy Christians of the Caucasus consider themselves broadly Georgian. Disillusioned with the tales of mighty forefathers such as David the Builder, the lonesome faithful now refer to themselves by their tribal and provincial names of old, believing the names and identities of their localities far stronger foundations to cling to under the threat of foreign oppression than any foolhardy Georgian kingdom."

These lands cry out for a new order and we have come- but this victory poses us a question. The peoples of the former Ilkhanate are all invariably heathens, followers of Zoroaster and other mystical cults. While our Kingdom integrates these new provinces, the nobility and clergy presiding over the new possessions urge us to pursue a steadfast religious policy. These new peoples sorely long for a liberator and protector. They seem willing and eager to adopt our practices for the time being, namely our faith, but some believe our rule and administration would benefit from a temporary policy of benevolence and tolerance, strange as these heathen beliefs are."

The past has passed- all of that cannot be undone and history is history. However, new history can be made- and it has been made, today, as the Seljuq grip over Anatolia has been shattered by our mighty sword. Their ailing peasants and disgruntled subjects have been brought into our fold unanimously, flocking to our rule as their barbaric lords scatter and flee. Our generals and soldiers alike sing songs of victory and praise, drowning themselves in ale and music on this night of victory. Not only have we proved our worth as a military might, a fearsome beast not to be trifled with, but a shining light to cast out the darkness of steppe rule from a once proud Anatolia."

Watchtowers have been set alight and now lay crumbling. The subjugated populace scream and run amok, aghast at the blood filling the streets and the dens of heathen worship being torn asunder, ripped apart by our righteous faith. Mongol treasure rooms have been looted and ransacked, revealing treasures from other brutalised kingdoms and victims, some so alien that they must have hailed from far eastern Asia, telling of the horrific extent of the barbarian conquests. With the remainders of Sarai's garrison fleeing like cowards into the vast plains, the Horde as a whole has been dealt a crushing blow, falling into humiliated disarray as Georgia extends her protection to the captured city and its vital river system."

Across the kingdom, various churches and noble estates find themselves besieged by enraged crowds, beseeching the entirely fair and honourable taxes imposed upon them and the 'dire labour shortages' in their shanty little villages. Whatever that means. Most prominent is the uprising in Gori, spearheaded by a charismatic and intelligent church scholar, Ioseb Jughashvili. Ioseb has garnered a great deal of populist support and displays an impressive aptitude towards not only guerilla fighting and basic tactics, but also brutal suppression and intimidation of political opponents and other peasant rabble. He has whipped up a disgusting propagandistic cocktail in the process, spreading strange writings and notions of 'a people's kingdom' and 'equality of wealth'. While this poses a great threat to our weakened and depleted forces, it must be confessed that Ioseb has done a marvellous job at mustering a fighting force, defeating rivals and creating a 'people's revolution'.

Even the mighty Theodosian Walls, those mighty fortifications which have never been sieged now lay bare and open before our conquest. \n \nAnd yet, we understand the importance of the city, and why the Byzantines fought so hard to protect it. It is placed at the heart of the Bosporus, where trade and people flow from Asia to Europe, and the monuments built still give even the most downtrodden of souls a feeling of awe and wonder. Should we seek to rebuild it, it would be a fantastic location for a new capital. It could be the center from which our Empire expands, where our people live in glory and splendor underneath the light of Allah and the words of the Prophet. We, the mighty Seljuk, could bring about a rebirth to this ancient capital. All we would have to do is take the first step and begin its reconstruction…"

We can expand and take Muslim land, bringing it under our realm as a part of the Seljuk Caliphate. We can also rush to the defense of any of our neighbors with this title, protecting them against incursions from heretics and heathens. Our only obstacle now is the Umayyads of Iberia, who also claim the title of Caliph for themselves. We shall wipe them out, proving our dominance and securing our legitimacy over all Muslims."

Our long push into the Yuan had left our men exhausted and filled with anger, as the aging empire had fought with all its might to stand against us. By the time our soldiers reached the capital, their rage was palable; this palace would not be the last place they would ransack throughout the day. With our long campaign into the north finally finished, the emperor proclaimed to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] administrators and generals that a new era was upon them. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] spoke of how they had reconquered the west that they had lost centuries ago during the invasion of the Song; how the mantle of heaven would soon be theirs. This proclamation confused those present who believed this to be a war of conquest, not reclamation. However, those seldom few in the emperor’s audience that had dove into the classics of their past knew what this meant. Some began to cheer, others clapped. As [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] soldiers secured their new territory, [Root.Monarch.GetName] ordered the production of new banners, granted new titles, and drew up the new royal standards.

While the emperor and his sycophantic entourage may have fled, Yuan's treasury is largely intact, leaving us with a great abundance of plunder for the troops to divide as spoils of war. Alas, chaos is rampant in the streets, with panicking citizens - and even the imperial guard - engaging in widespread looting across affluent districts, while non-combatants desperately scramble to escape, or hurl themselves from the walls. While the line of Temüge never intended to outright destroy Yuan, but rather reform it into a bastion of the True Faith and Mongol people, it is abundantly clear now that the empire of Kublai Khan is in its death throes.

Henceforth, the Emperor shall be seen as Christ's Messenger on Earth, his rule ordained by the Lord, but no longer be viewed as a false Son of God. Furthermore, the Nestorian Church shall be responsible for taking over from Confucian scholars, with the Patriarch of Mongolia responsible for crowning each successive Khagan.

With Lothair III Carolingian’s - and thus the Kingdom of Francia’s - downfall, boundless gateways of opportunity have opened up for the Hohenstaufen-ruled realm of Lotharingia; its greatest opponent to expansion vanquished henceforth. With Francia and the Carolingian cronies out of the picture - hopefully for good - the Imperial Diet convened in Aachen to discuss how to deal with the unravelling situation. It comes as no surprise, then, that the Hohenstaufens’ deep pockets have convinced the council to unanimously support Lotharingia’s entry into the Holy Roman Empire. Though blatantly an excuse to consolidate the dynasty’s holdings, the Hohenstaufen argument that the power vacuum West of the Rhine should be filled - ideally by a formerly integral part of Charlemagne’s empire - still rang true to many; Andalusia lies just beyond the Pyrenees and is likely more than eager to also seize on the moment. What lays ahead for Lotharingia, the Holy Roman Empire’s newest addition, remains unclear. What is certain, however, is that all eyes are on this new actor upon the world stage."

The ruling house of Gabras now claims that their troops are the true successors of Iskandar and his phalanx, that their discipline is equivalent to those of the legendary warriors that conquered their way from Macedon to India. This is laughable. Our Sultan has decided to establish his very own military academy in Iskandariyya to cement the supremacy of our troops in professionalism, arms, and tactics.

The current Caliph is our puppet from the House of Abbas, who has become an increasing nusiance through the deacdes. For centuries, the Caliph was content to hold only ceremonial power over us, and allowed the Sultan to administer his realm as the true sovereign, but more recent puppet-Caliphs have become proggressively more bold, attempting to undermine the Sultan and drum up support among legitimists so that they might restore the House of Abbas' power and depose us. For this reason, the Sultan has decided to dismiss the Caliph. Permanently. He will be sent to an estate in Baghdad where he can retire peacefully after being ritualistically stripped of his title, which will be relinquished to [Root.Monarch.GetName], who will reign as the first Caliph of the House of Nizzar, establishing our de jure right to rule and conquer."

Despite the folly of past administrations, our Sultan, dedicated in his pursuit of knowledge as any Islamic leader should be, has financed a massive undertaking to restore the House of Wisdom in an aesthetic and scholastic capacity; employing the greatest artisans to reconstruct its facade and interior, and importing scripture, research, and literature from accross the world to restock the shelves at the House's library. The new official name of the building-complex will now be the Abbasid Academy of Art, Literature, and Science, to further placate our puppet-caliph from the house of Abbas, who shall now return to Baghdad, where he will 'rule' under the watchful eye of our handlers."

 ab_byzantium.4.t:0 "The Osman & Sons Trading Company"
 ab_byzantium.4.d:0 "A Turkish merchant dynasty claiming descent from a little-known Bey by the name of Osman, the Osmanoglu family are nothing short of celebrities to the Greek people of the Near East. Their greatest accomplishment after Osman’s exile into the Byzantine Empire was their creation of the wealthiest and most respected merchant guild in the Balkans and Near East: the Osman & Sons Trading Company. This colossal trade empire has brought in enough wealth and favours over the years to have thus far ensured the Byzantines’ survival, despite the ailing realm’s overwhelmingly sorry state. Headquartered in great Constantinople, Osman & Sons is the primary benefactor of numerous spectacles - such as the esteemed Hippodrome races and ship races in the Bosporus Strait - as well as sole proprietor and founder of the world-renowned Ottoman Grand Bazaar. Headed since the age of 16 by the esteemed Murad Osmanoglu, the second of his name to preside over such a prestigious organisation, the affectionately-dubbed “Sultan of Rum” is preparing his favourite son Mehmed for the future role of leadership. Under Murad and his descendants, Osman & Sons will surely flourish well into the future, as it has for many generations prior."
 ab_byzantium.4.a:0 "Long live the “Sultan of Rum”!"
 ab_byzantium.5.t:0 "The Reign of Mehmed Fatih"
 ab_byzantium.5.d:0 "With the passing of esteemed Osmanoglu family scion Murad II, the role of leadership has fallen into the lap of his young and ambitious son Mehmed, also the second of his name to assume the mantle of leadership over Osman & Sons Trading Company. Nicknamed “Fatih”, or “the Conqueror”, for the total acquisition of the Theodoran Ostrogothia Company’s assets this past summer, Mehmed Fatih is a shining example to all merchants of the Byzantine Empire. By taking the helm of this most splendid vessel, the young Turkish trader has earnt himself the Imperial Court’s favour, and has been offered a seat on the Basileus-Autokrator’s council; a great honour which was first held by his father. A master of commerce rises to the occasion, and no doubt holds the future in his hands."
 ab_byzantium.5.a:0 "Assuming Direct Control"
 ab_byzantium.6.t:0 "The “Janissaries”"
 ab_byzantium.6.d:0 "The Osman & Sons Trading Company has as many enemies as they do friends, both within the cities and along the vast trade routes their caravans dominate. In order to deter attacks against their merchants and assets, the Osmanoglu family under Murad I, its head in the mid-late 14th Century AD, had established a private security group which would be loyal solely to the Family. Nicknamed the “Janissary Corps” due to the sourcing of young recruits from across the Balkans and Near East, this elite force of eager and able-bodied warriors is strong enough to take on any hostile actions against their paymasters in Constantinople. Legendary Albanian mercenary captain and Bulgar War veteran Gjergj “Skanderbeg” Kastrioti, nicknamed thusly for his Alexanderesque martial genius, presently holds command over the force, and is himself no stranger in the Imperial Court. When not presiding over Janissary operations, Skanderbeg is often contracted as either a field commander by the Byzantine Imperial Army, or advisor to military high command. Such a larger-than-life character only appears once, and so Osman & Sons sees fit to utilise his skills as much as possible."

Gifted at commerce and administration - not to mention well-read and amicable, even under his father’s tenure Suleiman showed great promise. Furthermore, having served in the Imperial bodyguard, the young Ottoman trade magnate garnered enough military training to confidently lead several caravans across Asia himself. A legendary figure amongst Eurasian traders and mercenaries, Suleiman’s character and accomplishments were described by even the Basileus-Autokrator as “magnificent”. Poet, soldier, and trader; it is time for Suleiman the Magnificent to propel his trade empire and fatherland to heights never before achieved."

 ab_byzantium.8.t:0 "Dump It?"
 ab_byzantium.8.d:0 "The Osman & Sons Trading Company has made perhaps the most unexpected yet splendid purchases in the history of commerce: complete acquisition of its greatest competition in Europe. As the most eminent trading empire in Novgorod, the Bogdanoff & Bogdanoff Merchant’s Guild was a titan of unmatched proportions for nearly a century, dominating every English scillinga and Hanseatic mark flowing through the Slavic markets. However, for reasons unbeknownst to even the Osmanoglu family’s agents, they were approached with an offer of acquisition by representatives of Bogdanoff & Bogdanoff’s enigmatic co-owners; rarely-seen twins of noble stock. The power dynamic of Eastern Europe has shifted in favour of the House of Osman’s intrepid merchants for the first time in its history, and previously-untapped markets throughout Europe are now opening up through their newly-integrated trade network. As for the Brothers Bogdanoff, who can say? Perhaps they saw the writing on the wall when Byzantine merchants got their own trade quarter in Great Novgorod, or perhaps they merely saw it in their best interests to bestow the financial burden unto others. In any event, their near-prophetic market speculation and comprehension of global commerce is sure to create a nigh-invincible trade hegemony."

Barely surviving the bloodbath, Tiepolo returned to Rome and retired his office, partially blaming himself for the devastating defeat. Now that the Eternal City itself is under a threat of a Muslim invasion, the Holy See recalled him back, giving him a chance to redeem his name and reputation on the battlefield."

Immediately alerted to a strange man stumbling around the castle, Lothair was promptly captured. Clapped in irons while awaiting trial in the castle, word of Lothair’s imprisonment has brought about a calm which had been unheard of since the start of the revolt. Many breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing the news, knowing that the tyrant who plunged the kingdom into such a dreadful state will soon face justice. A new day dawns on Francia, and the victorious nobles have been revelling in their unexpected victory all night.

Due to that, Boyars of Novgorod have been pushing the government to take an action and start a military campaign in which they wanted to bring weaker Princes under our suzerainty, but their request fell on deaf ears.

Frankish merchants have even begun to re-enter and greatly boost commerce. There is one massive thorn in Francia’s side, however. In the centuries since its capture, the population of Calais was most cruelly displaced as the vile invaders spread into the streets and festered. What was left behind was a gaping wound in the empire’s former staple port. This shall stand no longer, if the merchants have anything to say about it.

The city of Cordoba - a sight so magnificent that even His Holiness’ legates marveled at what the Moors had built - now rests in Christian hands, where it shall now remain for all time, God permitting. This did not come without significant cost, however, as the victory of the Cross could at best be described as heroic, but more cynically as pyrrhic. Following weeks of skirmishes and several artillery barrages, Umayyad forces amassed outside the battered gates, unwilling to let the heart of the Caliphate be tarnished by blood and steel. Indeed, the hearts of Francia’s finest wavered upon seeing such a great host muster. Were it not for the siege commander’s rallying cry and subsequent charge into the Caliph’s ranks, the battle may have turned into a rout.

This disaster has proven to be a dismal affair for the learned men of Francia, especially those in the universities and administration. Having been unpaid for months on end, the literate have resorted begun emigrating to other corners of the Holy Roman Empire in search of new – hopefully wealthy – employers. Even much of the royal court has started to walk out, as only the most important advisors have been given any sort of financial compensation over the past year. The matter at hand is dire, for little can be done when funds would be better redirected into maintaining the levies at maximum capacity.

With the realm’s coffers empty and thousands of men – who would have otherwise worked the fields – never returning from the war, tax revenue has dropped to a mere trickle of what it once was. It doesn’t help that, in order to appease the nobles, taxes were eased to “compassionate levels” for their “unfathomable losses”. It is clear now that such a decision failed to do anything but give the barons carte blanche to pay as little tax as possible, and Francia as a whole suffers for their greed. The threat of famine now seems all too real without men working the fields or the income to import food from abroad. Some of the more daring courtiers have suggested that the taxes be increased once again in order to help rebuild the kingdom’s economy and countryside, but nobody will be too keen about seeing the sheriffs making the rounds once more."

Many contributions were donated to the coffers of the crusading army, including extensive loans from a number of eminent barons within the realm. The barons were promised reimbursement in the form of tribute which would be offered to them in annual payments by the Andalusian Caliphate, in the event of a Crusader victory. Unfortunately, the massacre of the emperor and much of the nobility at Valencia - and the attrition suffered by the survivors - saw a crushing defeat for the Catholics which has spiraled Francia into crippling debt. Now, one of the barons who had promised the old sovereign a loan for the crusade has demanded that he be compensated immediately, as many of his men failed to return and his lands are falling on hard times. It would certainly be a great boon to keep the barons on side, but Francia’s coffers are sorely depleted.

As much as the people may lose confidence at Francia’s inability to react to hostile intent, they ought to realise that, in these trying times, battles must be chosen. This humiliation will not be forgotten, that much is assured. If the increasing number of totally desolate villages is anything to go by, the Lotharingians know their day of reckoning will come.

While disobedient commoners is bad enough, matters have been made worse by word that droves of young men have entered the service of the rebel forces, evidently trying to bring about the Empire’s downfall. Little can be done, as the state’s resources and manpower are diverted elsewhere, leaving a number of villages almost entirely lacking in able-bodied men of fighting age.

Everyone has had their suspicions about who the Last Carolingian’s progeny might be – especially given that, to this point, the fact that he has numerous concubines throughout the realm was an ill-kept secret at best. Many more bastards likely remain anonymous to the realm, and may potentially be oblivious to their illegitimate heritage, but it is clear that a slapdash effort at grooming the so-called “true heir” was made in recent years – if not months or weeks. This has obviously caused tremendous uproar amongst not just the aristocracy, most of whom had wished for Lothair to shrivel up and die, but also the clergy, as they had neither legitimised nor approved of this child born out of wedlock. While the Carolingian line might be able to preserve itself in a greatly weakened state now that Lothair has a confirmed son, the ramifications for the dynasty’s place in the Frankish realm will be felt well after the revolt has ended – regardless of which side wins. Indeed, this rash choice may have even bolstered the barons’ cause, as few would willingly bend the knee to an until-recently unheard-of upstart."

There was not a kingly or princely court in Europe which could match Versailles for the opulence of its gilded interiors, its mirrors and chandeliers, with an appropriately matching flamboyance of courtly ceremony, and there was not a kingly or princely court in Europe which did not, either openly or secretly, aspire to match this model."

Addressing the crowd in Paris, the king vividly describes the events which took place in the bloody Battle of Valencia, capturing their attention. From the near-capitulation of the city’s Umayyad garrison, to a mass charge by Umayyad cavalry sweeping aside much of the Frankish vanguard, it was almost as though the king was there himself. He sang the praises of the heroic German mercenaries and Iberian Christians, who - though overwhelmed - fought to the bitter end in order to buy the other Crusaders time, while also condemning the Italians, who had fled prior to battle without alerting the Franks to the approaching Umayyad host. Even admitting respect for Valencia’s crafty garrison commander, who led the remaining defenders in a final sally against the Imperial besiegers and catching them off guard, drew mutual agreement from those in attendance. The most poignant tribute was, of course, to the valiant last stand of Emperor Robert IV, who had along with his retinue fought their way to the Caliph’s honour guard, but were ultimately cut down after a final holdout. Robert the Blessed, as he is known to the people of the Holy Roman Empire, would have been survived by his only child, Crown Prince Louis, had he not also been slain in the battle; cut down while trying to retrieve his father’s standard. The king made pertinent use of the ensuing Carolingian Succession Crisis as a warning that one should never overestimate their own abilities if their position is precarious in nature, but concluded the speech with a solemn vow to ensure that Christendom will be avenged for its staggering losses, for a repeat of Valencia was out of the question. Ending the ceremony with a memorial parade around the centre of Paris and the laying of a wreath at the tomb of Blessed Robert, the sight of several thousand Parisians - noble and commoner alike - performing hymns of praise and commemoration was a stirring moment to behold. The promise of reclaiming lost honour lingered amongst the populace until the next day, by which point everything returned to the way it was two days prior."

Such a ruinous occasion, yet also full of many chivalrous anecdotes, the occasion has become near-legendary. It is for this reason that, even centuries after the battle took place, the people of France will readily gather for a solemn day of memorial to honour those who perished during the Andalusian Crusade. Little about the ceremony - outside of the kings’ speeches - have changed over the years, emphasising just how culturally impactful the Battle of Valencia’s lingering spectre is. Promises of peace made at these occasions never last long, but even then, the hope included is enough to hold on to.

 ab_frc_disaster_event.0.d:0 "The Frankish realm is in dire straits, with the economy in tatters and the nobles squabbling amongst themselves. The Carolingian dynasty has sat upon the Frankish throne since the reign of Pepin the Short, ushering in a safe and secure society for their new empire - for a time. Though met with numerous crises before, many handled worse than anticipated, there is little doubt that the coming storm may prove to be the most catastrophic in Francia’s long and well-documented history. \n \nThe troubles began with the Andalusian Crusade, led by the Frankish emperor himself in an effort to liberate the Christians under Umayyad oppression. Sadly, despite making strong gains in the first few months, both he and his sole male heir met their end in the brutal Battle of Valencia. Much of the royal treasury had been put into funding this campaign, and many men were called off to war despite it nearing harvesting season. Thus, when the tattered remnants of the once-proud royal retinue entered the gates of Paris, it was clear that all the Frankish people had been banking on was lost. \n \nLothair, the late emperor’s estranged uncle, may not have been popular with the subjects, but as the last male Carolingian his claim was the strongest. This cruel new King of the Franks has done little more than embezzle the money owed to his own barons, inflict cruel and unusual punishments upon his enemies, and engage in utterly reprehensible acts of debauchery which have accrued further debt. His ignorance to the suffering of his own subjects and refusal to intervene in the economy have finally found the final nail needed to strike into Lothair’s coffin: his notable lack of any legitimate heir. Despite his many concubines in each of the royal residences, little evidence actually exists of Lothair having children - let alone male ones. Thus, fearing that the aging monarch’s lack of issue might spur a succession war the likes of which hasn’t been seen since the Ottonian Era, the nobles have presented Lothair with two options: to step down and enter self-imposed exile with a royal allowance, or face open rebellion."

The excesses and arbitrary attitude of Lothair have proven to be the last piece of kindling on his funeral pyre. The aristocrats of Francia have taken up arms against their liege.

With the last hostile stronghold capitulating, albeit begrudgingly, in the face of the triumphant party's supremacy as the sun rose overhead, the exhausted soldiers took it as a sign from the Heavens. Wary of the instability this war has caused, it appears that Francia's leadership has begun cracking down on suspected rivals and paying off potential allies, for rebellious sentiment can now only be upheld through backroom deals.

After the Imperial forces collapsed following the fall of the Royal Capital in Paris, the rebel armies sacked the city for several days and nights. In the confusion, it appears that Emperor Lothair had attempted to escape, caked in makeup and stuffed inside his concubine’s frilly multicoloured dress. Immediately alerted to a strange man stumbling around the castle, Lothair was immediately captured. Clapped in irons while awaiting trial in the castle, word of Lothair’s imprisonment has brought about a calm which had been unheard of since the start of the revolt. Many breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing the news, knowing that the tyrant who plunged the kingdom into such a dreadful state will soon face justice. A new day dawns on Francia, and the victorious nobles have been revelling in their unexpected victory all night. The festivities will likely continue until the new king is placed in power, though much rebuilding is to be done if Francia wishes to recover..."

Captured while attempting to flee Paris disguised as a royal concubine, Lothair was dragged back to the royal court where he faced a show trial and no end of torment. The assembled nobility unanimously called for the deposed monarch’s public judgement and humiliation, a spectacle for the embittered peasantry and a step into a brave new world for the nobility. It was no secret that Lothair was unable to produce any legitimate heirs, and while a loss of legitimacy may be expected from ousting the last Carolingian, it was argued to be a necessary sacrifice if Francia were to survive. With his battered crown and frilly dress sold to a rather eccentric antiquarian, the question now comes down to Lothair’s successor. A cadet branch still lives on in the Nibelungens, though a number of powerful barons from across Francia have also been considered as potential candidates. May God favour the new King better than the last…"

An examination of the body found no sign of foul play, shutting down rampant rumours of regicide. Indeed, the late Emperor had been complaining of severe headaches since shortly before he took the throne in 1443. Whatever the case, Lothair has passed in the middle of a succession crisis without legitimate issue, meaning that the main Carolingian line has become extinct, and Francia is without a sovereign. Celebration and public displays of joy trailed closely behind news of the loathsome monarch’s unexpected demise, sweeping Francia like wildfire. The sudden realisation that they would face an impending power vacuum was not lost, however, on the aristocrats. Ever since Lothair’s refusal to abdicate sparked the civil war raging on until today, many noble families had aspired to assume the mantle of kingship upon the deposition of Lothair, following a peer vote. Of course, legal recognition of kingship will have to wait until a new pretender can even come out atop the others. All that’s left in the god-forsaken succession crisis is a mad dash to the capital, Paris, where the treasury and crown lie in wait. The first warlord to reach the city will likely be able to proclaim themselves king, but this will not be taken lightly. Deep-set rifts between the nobles already exist, and usurpation of the crown during an interregnum will be met with hostility on all sides. Though peace will not come easily, this is the only way for Francia to move forward. The only question now is, who will seize the capital from under their rivals’ noses?"

While the prosperity of Alexandria is undeniable, the entire system propping it up is morally corrupt; little can be observed beyond blatant idolatry and worship of foreign customs. The most noteworthy sights, worshipped by the Grecophilic sultans, are of course the Great Lighthouse - damaged extensively by earthquakes - and the tomb of the legendary conqueror Alexander. While not inherently wrong to honour feats as great as his, the unmasked worship of a mere man’s remains is grossly out of line, no matter their legacy. The most hardline among the Umayyad ranks are calling for the total destruction of this so-called “Soma”, as well as the tearing down of the decaying lighthouse. They argue that, as well as destroying the heart of decadence in the Near East, the salvaged masonry can be used in far grander projects elsewhere in the realm. Of course, opposition has flared up. While agreeing that idolatry and the cult of Alexander are unacceptable, they believe that the mausoleum can simply be sealed up, ideally with iconography masked through renovations. They also make a case that, while expensive to repair, the Lighthouse of Alexandria could maintain an air of prestige and culture among the court whilst also protecting sea routes."

For a thousand years the mighty jewel of the East stood proudly, for the most part unscathed by enemy invasion. That was, at least, until our forces overwhelmed the city’s defences and breached the Theodosian Walls. Following a desperate last stand by the Palace Guard, in which the garrison commander reportedly fell in combat, the few remaining defenders have been isolated into small pockets or otherwise dispersed. Though some looting has already occurred - mostly in the residential districts - the palace and merchant districts are still mostly untouched. The question posed to us now is how the occupation of the former Byzantine capital should proceed. While sacking the city for all it’s worth can certainly provide a significant portion of loot and marble, any damage to the Hagia Sophia or imperial tombs will undoubtedly make us many perpetual enemies, not to mention greatly infuriate the already-upset population. On the other hand, though the army certainly won’t be happy about this, we can try and forge a merciful image by merely repurposing the great wonders of this city - at a price, of course."

The French Menace is a threat no more, having been driven out of even its own capital. Paris’ fall came as a shock to only those aloof aristocrats in Central Europe, for the writing was on the wall that the time of the dastardly Frenchmen had come to an end the moment they lost Aquitaine. As jubilant Muslim soldiers parade around the cobbled streets, clergymen and nobles alike hurriedly prepare their flight to safety elsewhere in the world. The commoners aren’t as lucky, instead being forced to scrape together as much wealth as they can in order to pay for safe passage outside the city walls, only to be turned back around and marched home, for a fully depopulated city is the last thing the Caliphate needs. While no open hostilities had occurred in large scale after the defenders’ surrender, and conduct between forces was largely cordial, there is talk among the occupation force that small bands of militiamen are raiding Muslim caravans and ambushing small guard patrols. Whether these rumours are true or not, it is safe to assume that the people of Paris will be unreceptive to more than basic cooperation for the foreseeable future. The now-dethroned King of Francia has also sworn to avenge these losses, although it is unlikely that such a dream could ever become a reality. Dissent aside, though, the Caliphate rejoices at the greatest blow that could ever be dealt to Western Europe, short of sacking the city of Rome. It has become clear to the greatest extent that Francia will be buried beneath the sands of time, like the Romans they had so desperately tried to emulate, by a superior foe."

Although it is widely accepted that the Umayyads are the rightful, sole Caliphs, the treasonous vipers in the Nizzarid Sultanate thought otherwise. Whether attempting to usurp or subvert Andalusian legitimacy and power, the Abbasid charlatans - rescued from Mongol destruction - were propped up as puppet-Caliphs in the city of Cairo. From this gilded cage, at the behest of their wicked masters, innumerable instances of foul rumours and intrigue spilled outwards and across the Near East and Africa to defame the true Caliph’s standing. After what seems like an eternity of degradation at the hands of upstart pretenders, it is only fitting that the Abbasid scion - now in Umayyad custody, having been abandoned by his own kin - shall face punishment for his crimes and those of his forebears."

A beacon of hope for Catholicism amidst a sea of heathens and feudal squabbles, there are few honours greater than being in control of the Papal heartland. Now, though, all is lost. The Holy See has been decisively and efficiently crushed in battle, and was unable to save its seat. With only the city garrison and Papal guards still standing watch, the walls were easily overwhelmed and only small skirmishes could be maintained in the streets. Unlike the militias, the Swiss Guard fought bravely and to the last man, holding the Vatican’s chokepoints so the Pope could make his escape, and will likely be seen as martyrs - even earning the respect of their Muslim foes. With the population either fleeing or seeking refuge atop the Capitoline Hill, it is only a matter of time until the city is pacified. As no serious threat remains, there is one major issue which will directly impact the city’s fate. That is, what is to be done with the Vatican - the nucleus of Catholicism? A strong call has been made to destroy Saint Peter’s Basilica and the bones of the eponymous Apostle which lay within; a message that resistance shall not be tolerated. Others would argue that the marvels of the Holy See should be preserved, as a show of good will to the ever-crumbling Catholic faithful. Surely the former would strike fear into the ailing heart that is Western Christendom, though the latter will undoubtedly make the infidel more compliant to Umayyad rule in the future."

Victory was not expected, despite the Christians being outnumbered and in a poor position relative to the Umayyads - the clash itself was proof of this. Putting up fierce resistance for many hours, it was only when the cunning garrison commander within the City of Valencia sallied forth - catching the Catholics off guard - that the tide turned. When our valiant forces isolated much of the army into pockets, even cutting down the crusading Emperor and Crown Prince amidst the chaos, it was as if Allah himself had witnessed the righteousness of the Umayyad cause. Though begrudgingly, even the Christians had to admit the Caliph was magnanimous enough to prevent a pursuit of the fleeing infidel, but the scars run deep. Addressing the crowds within Valencia, the current Caliph and the victorious commanders’ descendants commemorate those who fell in the battle, praising their sacrifice. Swearing that the Centenaries of this bloody day shall forever be occasions of mourning and remembrance, the occasion is ended with the firing of a bombard and a victory parade through the city’s streets and out to the memorial monument. The promises that such needless bloodshed shall never happen again on Umayyad soil are well-received by those assembled, though time will tell if the Caliph can keep his word."

Although the commemorative monument is weather-worn and the road to it well-trod, the memory of an event which hasn’t affected anybody alive at this time is burning as brightly as ever. The remembrance ceremony is held in the same manner as the first Centenary, even finishing with a bombard salute and victory parade to the memorial, but the crowds are nonetheless captivated as their forefathers were. Promises of an end to conflict are absorbed and applauded - even if not likely to come true - and as the next day begins, everything returns to the status quo."

While many would have liked to believe the civil war’s ramifications have been largely put behind us, rumours of a shortened route to the Orient have been swirling around the Caliph’s court in recent weeks. A large majority of the entrenched nobility and intellectuals reject such notions as pure folly, but there are a daring few who think there is a kernel of truth to such tall tales. One such individual has recently approached the Grand Vizier, seeking an audience with the Caliph himself in an effort to accrue funds for an expedition into the great unknown. It is a very risky endeavour, with no promise of success or reward, but in the off chance that his hunches are proven correct, the endeavours of this intrepid explorer shall certainly prove a great boon to our stagnating economy. The choice of whether or not we shall expand beyond our current horizons now lies in the hands of the Caliph. Whatever the decision, we hope it proves to be the wise one…"

He didn't need or want to listen to his advisors rabble over petty issues each day, but it was his duty and destiny to do so. He continued listening: "-other pretender army marches from the North, in hopes of capturing Majrit, our generals say that we are ready to intercept and destroy them. Should we do it or wait until we know they are alone?" Just as the Caliph was about to answer, the door of the room opened, a messenger who looked around with wary eyes, searching for the Caliph in the crowd of advisors and generals - he finally saw him and  bowed down in front of his ruler, then gave him the letter and left the room. The Caliph opened the letter and was shocked. "Well?" one advisor said, "What's the matter?" The Caliph started reading: "Dear Brother, it is hard for me to do this. My heart won't bear to see you go down. But it is my duty! You have made more blunders than I can count! The people are sick of you, the nobility  hates you - you can't keep going like this. I do what I do with the best interests of the people in mind. Know this, dear brother, for when we meet again, be it on the battlefield or in your throne room."

A betrayal most cruel, this great hero of the war against the European Infidels was honoured throughout the realm.

Unfortunately, the decision to allow the Imperial forces to flee in the aftermath of Balansiyah - and also to repatriate the vanquished Emperor’s and Crown Prince’s remains to Francia - proved grossly divisive. Atop the political grumblings, much of the northern countryside lies devastated. Massacred villages, sacked religious sites, and scorched farmlands have left the region impoverished and its people displaced. Furthermore, organised raids from the last Christian holdout realms into Andalusia have inflicted a vastly detrimental psychological effect on those both in and outside of city walls. Of course, the Caliph has done nothing to assist in the situation. He delegates and watches, but never intervenes. Disloyal elements within the realm have been long-entrenched, as with all states, and in these desperate times, they have begun to make their move.

With the inaction of the Umayyad Caliph and subsequent outbreak of the Andalusian Civil War, the strain put on Castile’s food supply and production has proven too great for the farmers and merchants to bear. The surviving fields have been rendered non-arable due to overfarming and looting troops moving towards enemy lands. To make matters worse, trade has ground to a halt - in no small part due to the opportunistic warbands lurking near roadsides, thus provisions are no longer reaching the most heavily-affected areas. As a result of Castile’s inability to provide for its population, a region-wide famine has broken out and threatens to further harm the war effort.

The Shogun had come to rely on the Daimyo’s armies for security, and while he attempted to keep them separated and weak so they may never rebel, the cracks in his regime continued to show after the Shogun was powerless to stop a peasant revolt near Edo. Many Daimyo within the Shogunate saw the Shogun for what he was; a weakened ruler with neither an army or support and wanted to take their shot at being the leader. One such Daimyo went to the emperor, promising to enshrine them to their proper spot of political authority and power so long as they listen to what this daimyo said; essentially, the emperor would be a mouthpiece for this daimyo. \n \nHowever, the emperor was no fool. He had ambitions of his own. Turning on this Daimyo, he betrayed him to the Shogun by discretely leaking the information to the ruler. At the same time, he also won the support of this Daimyo’s followers and allies, claiming that the Shogun had unjustly attacked him. In a stunning move, the Shogun now had animosity from the vast majority of the Japanese elite, and the emperor had their support. With the Shogun’s authority ever weakening, they made a plea to the emperor; grant him a stipend and a residency to retire to, and he would abdicate to the emperor. The emperor accepted, and after 500 years, the Shogunate finally collapsed, and the emperor rose to power once more."

Thus, many statesmen in the imperial court have been attempting to find a new way to restructure the state. A running theme in this effort to centralize has been to model it around the emperor himself, as it is mostly due to his rule that this attempt is even possible. The emperor of course, agreed with this, and helped in crafting a new structure of the state.

The Mandate of Heaven is the weakest it has ever been, and the Chinese people growing weary of a disturbingly long string of spineless emperors. Far too many have proven themselves incapable of holding off invaders, curbing factionalism, or even carrying out reform. They do all this, despite drowning themselves in orgies of vice and extravagance unbefitting of a Son of Heaven. The Imperial system has thus been running on borrowed time, ready to completely collapse in on itself at the drop of a pin. Indeed, this is exactly what has just occurred, as vast numbers of armed militia – both from the peasantry and army deserters – have taken to the streets. They call for a Revolution against the archaic and bloated corpse that China as a political entity has become.

However, following reports of their arrest and detainment within the palace, nobody has received any status updates on the wellbeing of the imperial family. Whether or not the Emperor and his companions are safe, the public outcry to lynch them has certainly amplified the deafening silence which shrouds the Forbidden City. Fearing for the worst, especially given the Republicans’ reputation amongst monarchist circles, a cabal of loyalist officers, aristocrats, and even peasants have banded together to mount a desperate rescue mission.

When everything had come crashing down, we almost didn't realise what had happened, but through the crucible of bloody battle were the Mongol people born anew! Our unmatched horselords have swept through countless lands, bringing more and more foreign subjects into the fold. We, the Mongols, are the scourge of the steppes; the wolves of the plains, and our Empire has risen once more.

 ab_ottoman.1.d:0 "Although the Osman & Sons Trading Company has secured Byzantium the best deals for the right prices over the past 200 years, it would appear that the envy and avarice of the corrupt Angelid dynasty has pushed even their largest benefactors' loyalty to the limit. Caught attempting to extort additional discounts out of Murad and Mehmet, the current owners, the Basileus' court saw fit to double down on bullying the traditional and proudly Ruman family-owned business by ordering the Grand Bazaar's goods to be seized by the state. Additionally, the Byzantine senate forced through a motion which would impose a 78% state tax on all Osman & Sons sales income, on top of levying a 90% market fee against the Ottomans' trading partners abroad. All this has done, however, is alienate many patrons of the Grand Bazaar, while also whipping up the general populace of crumbling Constantinople into a frenzy. In response to growing resentment, the Angelids' most recent blunder, the order to conduct a massacre of the Merchant Quarter of the Golden Horn, was intercepted by some of mercenary captain Skanderbeg's spies, who then spread the information to the public. With riots now cropping up across the last vestiges of Byzantine land, responsibility for the rebellion has been accepted by the president and proprietor of Osman & Sons, Murad, and his son Mehmet, who now seek to transform the Balkan Peninsula into the Grandest Bazaar of them all; a land where prices are lower than freezing temperature, and the bargains are hotter than a Peloponnesian summer."

Establishing a republican government, lest a sleazy Angelid or some other claimant tries to ooze their way back into politics, it is expected that the new regime will be run by a council of traders and members of the Osmanoglu lineage; much more Romanesque than the abomination known as Late Byzantium, and more competitive to boot. In overcoming their old masters and forging something far greater, the Ottoman Trade Empire has already leapt over one hurdle, but to achieve the ambitions of the Osmanoglu family and their benefactors from the Greek merchant guilds, plenty of work lies ahead of them.

More importantly, however, he was the supreme commander of the Janissary Corps - an elite band of foreign soldiers and mercenaries who acted as the Osmanoglu family's caravan and bodyguards prior to the creation of the Ottoman state. In the aftermath of his employers' overthrow of the Byzantine Empire, Murad allowed Skanderbeg to resign, while also granting the faithful Albanian safe passage to his homeland, which had been ravaged viciously during the Bulgar Wars some years prior.

While their strength has returned over the past couple of centuries, it is not yet sufficient enough to maintain permanent stability so far away from the Adriatic - nor can they expect to be able to seize the rest of the Greek islands and archipelago. To that end, negotiators under the employ of Osman & Sons have worked tirelessly to draft a document which would present the Venetians with a suitable trade for their Aegean possessions.

As for the Brothers Bogdanoff, who can say? Perhaps they saw the writing on the wall when Ottoman merchants got their own trade quarter in Great Novgorod, or perhaps they merely saw it in their best interests to bestow the financial burden unto others.

Countless brave young men died that day, for nothing - their blood staining an ill-gotten, unworthy marsh, their trusted blades laying discarded amidst the untamed vegetation, lost to time.\n\n That fruitless venture echoes on in Norman minds.

By introducing a standardised form of French as the lingua franca, as well as buttering up and honouring French and Anglo Saxon nobility alike, we shall combine both wealthy possessions into one, seamlessly melding their matters together, robbing them blind of the hope of cultural autonomy and enriching our coffers, wallets, pockets and garrisons forevermore!"

 ab_heptarch_wars.1.t:0 "The Heptarch Wars"
 ab_heptarch_wars.1.d:0 "For several centuries the English monarchy has chafed under the buckling weight of the Witenagemot's dominance. Comprised of the kingdom's leading men, its most powerful clique consists of the Heptarchy; petty kings who rule de jure over England's seven constituent realms. Although their numbers have been reduced to a meagre four, of the Houses Westseaxe, Godwine, Hwicce, and Bamburgh, they exercise considerable influence over state affairs. Only a Heptarch is eligible to be elected Cyning by the Witan, and although the Wessex line has maintained their grasp on the throne since Edgar II's reign in the late 11th Century, his death in AD 1127 marked the beginning of the Heptarch Wars. Wessex's rivals all covet the throne, and have made several attempts to seize power, but each time the Crown has prevailed over its would-be usurpers. Some had hoped that the Peace of Eoforwic in AD 1395 would have returned England to the status quo, which it did - for a time. The Heptarchs were thwarted once before but Wessex, too, has atrophied much over the years. The Cyning's meddling in administrative affairs and attempts at reform have not gone unnoticed, and now the hourglass runs empty. Those envious magnates of Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria grow ever more desperate for power, now that their precious Witenagemot is at stake. Taking up arms against what they believe to be royalist tyranny, chroniclers will write of this Third Heptarch War as the 'time Christ and His angels were asleep'."

Fields are littered with the dead and dying; the vanquished were deemed traitors unfit for proper burial. Where once the crashing and thunder of battle echoed throughout the foggy moors, an oppressive silence now lingers. Nary a sound but the rustle of the wind can be heard as it sweeps through the burnt-out husks of homesteads and forts. This is the sound of peace, of triumph. A hard-fought war against kith and kin, followed by the most bitter harvest. The victorious Heptarch now parades in his bejewelled and elaborate armour, prancing about through every burgh and city which backed him as the royal retinue makes its way to Wintanceastre, the capital of the Cyningrice and the Pearl of Britannia. How long it will take to recover, nobody knows. Nor can it be divined as to when things may return to 'normal' - whatever that means in these dark times. What can be said, at least, is that England's times of internal trouble are now coming to an anticlimactic end. For better or for worse, the Heptarchy - and the realm as a whole - will never be the same again."

 ab_scottish.1.d:0 "As Alexander V Dunkeld walks the halls of his father’s palace in Edinburgh, he moves towards his son Edgar’s chambers; there is much to discuss. The Kingdom of Alba resides in a period of change and growth. The Monastic Revolution of the 14th Century saw the adoption of feudalism and the centralization of the state, but a shift of power from the Highland clans to the Lowland Scots. Alexander’s rule was one of balance, where attempts to manage the concerns of the clans, who feared their relevance dwindled, to the demands of lowland lords, who’s Anglo-Saxon influence brought with them great power and a sense of arrogance. Revolts from the northern clans, raids from the Norse, and pretenders backed by the knights of England have pressed Alexander up against the wall, and rumors of fell tidings has him anxious and paranoid. While he attempted to balance all the factions in the empire, he had only let it grow more divided, refusing to put down rivals in the name of peace. He needed to make sure Edgar was firm in his beliefs, well connected with allies, and strong enough to take a stance on the future of this great kingdom. Alexander’s final lesson to Edgar would be for him to walk his own path. As such, Alexander asked his son who would be best to educate him and guide him on the way forward."

Edgar the II recited this speech to his personal guard, only a few moments after his father was found with a dagger plunged into his back. Those that wished to tear down his father’s dream have thrown down the gauntlet, and as a pretender rose in the countryside to take his place, the young king martialled his troops, rallied his soldiers, and prepared to ride out to meet them. \n \n”For Glory!

His realm has to be one that reflects the true heritage of his people, not foreign traditions and customs. He would be High King of all the Clans, not some petty prince to the growing power of the English or Francia. When news of his father’s death at the order of an Anglo noble from Dumfries, Edgar knew what he must do. Riding out with his brave soldiers, they would hunt down the traitors to the crown and once more raise the Gaelic people to their spot of prominence and power! \n \n”For Glory! For God!

However, the [Root.GetAdjective] had already been struggling with their own identity towards the Church for the past few centuries. During the succession crisis of Edgar II, debates around the role of the Church were already starting to become common along with the debates on the Scottish identity, and now they were resurfacing as these refugees integrated into Scottish society. Figures such as John Knox argued for a complete restructuring of the Church into a modern institution, away from the decrepit and ageing medieval Catholic model. The Kirks of the era went back and forth in arguing for both independence from the Church and for loyalty to the Vatican.
