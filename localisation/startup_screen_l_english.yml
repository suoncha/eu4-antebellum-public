 string_start_maghreb:0 "The collapse of the §YAlmohad Caliphate§! in the 13th Century fractured §YIberia§! and the §YMaghreb§! into a multitude of warring states. This period of chaos was a perfect opportunity for the Christian kingdoms to wage their war of ‘Reconquista’, resulting in the annexation of all the Muslim states on the Peninsula with the sole exception of the Emirate of §YGranada§!.\n\nThe §YNasrids§! of §YGranada§! cling to their remaining territory as §YCastile§! makes repeated attempts to end Muslim rule in §YAndalucia§!. Granada cannot face the military might of Castile alone; if it is to survive it will need to make some powerful friends indeed. To add to Granada’s troubles, the Emirate is plagued with internal strife. At present the clearest threat is §YEmir Muhammad’s§! nephew, §YYusuf§!, who has ambitions for the throne and is rapidly gathering support to enforce his claim.\n\nThe §YZayyanids§! of §YTlemcen§! find themselves especially vulnerable. Tlemcen, locked between the stronger powers of §YTunis§! and §YMorocco§!, struggles to even maintain control over the population beyond the city of Tlemcen itself.\n\nThe most powerful of the Maghrebi kingdoms is the Sultanate of Morocco, ruled by the §YMarinid§! dynasty. Though they control a great deal of strategically and economically important territory, the Marinid rulers are little more than puppets of their §YWattasid§! viziers. Many within the Marinid family resent the Wattasid custodianship of Morocco, while the Wattasids themselves all but openly covet the throne for themselves. Being so concerned with internal mistrust, Morocco failed to defend the city of §YCeuta§! from a §YPortuguese§! assault in 1415 and have since been unable to recapture it.\n\nThe §YHasfids§! of Tunis were once governors in the service of the Almohads. When the Caliphate collapsed they continued to rule Tunis and have even awarded themselves the title of Caliph, though the Muslim world at large pays little heed to this bold claim. Of the three large kingdoms on the coast, Tunis is the least beset by internal struggle and is relatively free to make incursions into the surrounding states.\n\nIn the interior, the Berber tribes of §YMzab§!, §YDjerid§!, §YTouggourt§!, and §YFezzan§! all vie for dominance of the desert. Mzab follows the rare Ibadi sect of Islam, and its rulers descend from the Rustamid Imams who ruled a large part of the Maghrebi interior in the 9th Century. Though unlikely candidates to reunite the Maghreb, the nomads of the interior have had a great impact on the fate of North Africa many times in the past."
 string_start_tatars:0 "The §YGolden Horde§! is dead; its §YTatar§! successors fight over its corpse even as their enemies grow strong around them. The once great empire of §YJochi§!, son of §YGenghis Khan§!, has been divided into several Khanates each seeking dominance over the steppe.\n\nThe most direct successor to the Golden Horde is the §YGreat Horde§!. Controlling the cities of Sarai and Astrakhan, Khan Küchük Muhammad pronounces his hegemony over the steppe to deaf ears. The constituent tribes continue to break away from his rule and the Khan has thus far been unable to stop them.\n\nA Khan who is not feared even by his neighbors is barely a Khan at all; once mere tax-collectors, the Grand Principality of §YMuscovy§! has expanded greatly without a strong Khan to keep them in check. If they are left to grow they will surely seek to throw off the Tatar yoke entirely and conquer the steppes for themselves. Likewise, §YLithuania§! has benefitted from the collapse of the Golden Horde. They have already stolen Ruthenia away from Tatar control and will likely continue to pose a threat to the nomads.\n\n§YUlugh Muhammad§! of §YKazan§! has twice proclaimed himself Khan of the Golden Horde, but his reigns were short-lived. With the support of local Bolghar nobles he seized the city of Kazan and established a new Khanate in the northern steppe. Kazan is an important trade hub, and the new Khanate can easily access nearby veins of metals both precious and utilitarian. As the wealthiest of the Tatar realms, Kazan is both a promising state and a target for greedy invaders.\n\nThe §YCrimean Khanate§! broke from the Great Horde in 1441 after the Crimean clans invited §YHaci Giray§!, a descendent of Ghenghis Khan, to rule them. Giray led the Crimean Tatars in a bloody struggle for independence, eventually emerging victorious and as Khan of a new horde. The Crimeans are avid slavers, and must contend with the §YGenoese§! colonies for control of local trade. They have also attracted the interests of the §YOttoman§! Sultan, who keeps a watchful eye over the Khanate’s affairs.\n\nThe §YNogai§! and §YUzbek§! Khanates, while successful in their bid for independence and controlling vast stretches of the steppe, lack the wealth or strategic importance of the other successor states. Opportunism must be their guiding philosophy if they wish to claim any part of Genghis Khan’s legacy, and by great fortune it seems that their §YTimurid§! neighbors are close to collapse and civil war. A worthy Khan might take the chance to seize the cities of §YSamarkand§! or §YBukhara§! while the Timurids are distracted."
 string_start_romania:0 "The Principalities of §YWallachia§! and §YMoldavia§! are nested between powers much greater than themselves. Thus far they have survived by playing the dangerous game of offering fealty to whichever nation they believe most likely to protect them against the others. A Voivode who wishes to thrive must carefully observe the balance of power.\n\nThe Voivodes had long been members of the Order of the Dragon, a noble and knightly order dedicated to defending Christendom from the encroaching §YOttoman Empire§!. It was no surprise when the Principalities answered the call for the §YCrusade of Varna§!. This grand military coalition aimed to drive the Turks from the Balkans and restore Christian rule. The Crusade, however, was a devastating failure, leaving kingdoms broken and the future of the region insecure.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Crusade a diplomatic incident led to the §YHungarian§! general §YHunyadi§! being imprisoned by §YVlad II§! of Wallachia. Though the situation was resolved without further conflict, relations have soured enough that Wallachia should not count on Hungarian aid for the time being.\n\nThe Voivode of Wallachia joined the Crusade in spite of his son §YVlad Dracula§! being an Ottoman captive; unsurprisingly he now believes that his son must have been slain by Turkish hands. Unbeknownst to the Voivode an embittered Vlad was spared by the Sultan and lives in exile, plotting his revenge against Turk and Wallachian alike.\n\nUncertainty grips Moldavia also; the former monarch §YIlias I§! has died in exile in §YPoland§!, leaving his son §YRoman§! as a potential claimant to the throne. Roman has secured nominal Polish support for his claim, pledging eternal Moldavian fealty should he become Voivode. It is only a matter of time before Roman attempts to seize the throne from his uncle §YStefan§!."
 string_start_irish_minors:0 "§YIreland§! in [GetYear] is divided among many disparate clans in the wake of the collapse of direct §YEnglish§! rule. English control is now limited to a small area around Dublin, known as the §YPale§!.\n\nImmediately beyond the Pale are the domains of the Peerage of Ireland, the Earls of §YDesmond§!, §YOrmond§!, §YUlster§!, and §YKildare§!. These lords once governed in the name of the English crown, but their fealty is now nominal at best. They reign independently and often in defiance of English influence. Over the centuries the transplanted Anglo-Norman nobility have become as Irish as the population they govern. §YOffaly§! and §YLeinster§! are surrounded by potential enemies but also by opportunities for an aggressive ruler.\n\nIn the north, the Earldoms of §YTyrone§!, §YTyrconnel§!, and Ulster sit precariously in the path of both English and §YScottish§! expansionism. The §YO'Neill§! clan of Tyrone may have to put aside their pride and consider an alliance with one of these powers if they ever wish to restore the legacy of their legendary ancestor, High King Niall of the Nine Hostages.\n\n§YThomond§!, §YSligo§!, §YClanricarde§!, and §YMunster§! in the west and south are relatively safe from the ambitions of regional powers, at least for the time being. These clans have long and storied histories, claiming descent from Irish heroes such as Brian Boru and Carthach the Elder. If they choose to seize it, they have the opportunity to expand throughout Ireland and become powers in their own right.\n\nAn Ireland united by a High King seems like a distant dream, but a dynasty that can overcome both their Irish rivals and the English invaders may yet claim that title once again."
 string_start_provence:0 "In [GetYear], §YProvence§! is ruled by ambitious René d'Anjou, who styles himself not only as Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence, but also as the King of §YAragon§!, §YNaples§!, and §YJerusalem§!. The lords of Christendom pay little heed to these claims, yet Good King René is determined to reclaim his birthright.\n\nProvence controls a divided domain. Anjou is at the heart of the conflict between §YEngland§! and §YFrance§!, desired by both nations and likely to suffer from the coming wars. Provencal land in the Rhineland is split between the directly ruled Duchy of Bar and the subject Duchy of §YLorraine§!. Provence risks the ire of both the Holy Roman Emperor and the powerful Duchy of §YBurgundy§! if it chooses to meddle in affairs of the Rhineland Princes. The Duchy of Provence itself lies on the north coast of the Mediterranean, nested between France, §YSavoy§!, and the §YPapal§! city of Avignon. From here the ambitious René may launch an invasion of Aragon, though Italy may be a more tempting prize as the Empire's hold over the region wanes.\n\nProvence maintains good relations with its largest and most powerful neighbor, France. Provence must balance its own defensive needs and plans for expansion with French expectations of support should the Hundred Years war once again break out into open war.\n\nProvence is a nation with great ambitions, but even staving off annihilation may prove to be a challenge as surrounding nations eye its' lands greedily."
 string_start_brittany:0 "§YBrittany's§! situation in [GetYear] is much the same as in previous centuries. Caught between §YEngland§! and §YFrance§!, its Dukes have long had to struggle to maintain independence. France in particular has repeatedly made diplomatic and military attempts to annex Britanny into its domain.\n\nThe Second Treaty of Guérande, signed in 1381, formally declared Brittany neutral in the Hundred Years War. This conflict seems likely to once again lead to hostilities, as French demands for the surrender of §YMaine§! go unmet by England. How far the Dukes of Brittany will honour their promise of neutrality remains to be seen; there could be much to gain from involvement in the war, but also many dangers. Brittany is unlikely to be able to stand against either of the warring powers alone, and to that end may consider cooperation with the rising power of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nBrittany is a rich and fertile land with much potential for development. The capital of §YNantes§! has seen grand reconstruction efforts following a bloody succession war and currently stands as one of the major Atlantic port cities. The port of Brest meanwhile would make an ideal naval dockyard, being both a sheltered natural harbour and strategically located to intercept both French and English fleets.\n\nBrittany must choose its friends and enemies carefully if it's to survive in the modern era. If the tumultuous politics of Europe fail to offer opportunities, perhaps Brittany's destiny may lie beyond its shores."
 string_start_great_ming:2 "The Great §YMing§! Empire owes its origins to the collapse of the §YYuan§! dynasty from §YMongolia§! and the period of rebellion and strife that struck China in the mid-14th century. From this age of chaos, the Ming emerged as the greatest power in China, eliminating their Han rivals and pushing the descendants of §YKublai Khan§! back to the Great Wall. After eighty years of governance, the Ming have firmly established themselves as the preeminent power in East Asia.\n\nEven though Ming continues to prosper, its international presence has flagged since the end of Zheng He's voyages, and new realms have posed fresh challenges to the empire. In the divided north, nomads have begun to coalesce under the leadership of the §YOirat§! warlord §YEsen§!, who aspires to become the new Great Khan of all the Mongols. Ming diplomacy at least prevented a similar movement from happening among the §YJurchen§! tribes to the northeast, where Imperial policy has encouraged infighting among the nomads. While the fractious and distracted Jurchens are unlikely to pose a threat any time soon, Esen's Oirats may prove to be a very formidable foe indeed.\n\nMing's relations in the south are somewhat better. §YDai Viet§! freed itself from Ming domination only two decades prior, and still remains wary of its Chinese neighbor to the north. Other powers in the region have a more positive opinion of Ming, but mountains and jungles mean that Ming receives little more than token tributes from the southern kingdoms.\n\nMing's relations are strongest with the §YJoseon§! dynasty of §YKorea§!. Both Ming and the Joseon dynasty emerged from the ashes of the Great Yuan, and thanks to their common adherence to Confucian philosophy both have maintained strong bonds ever since.\n\nNot all of Ming's troubles are external; the §YMandate of Heaven§! is a fickle one, and if the Emperor's authority wavers too much then there are those who may choose to shun the Ming altogether. China would have to fall far indeed to reach such dire straits; in the 15th century, the Great Ming Empire is by far the strongest realm in Asia, and quite possibly on Earth!"
 string_start_mongolia:1 "The §YMongol Empire§! of §YGenghis Khan§! is gone, its successor states reduced to infighting on the fringes of civilization. The once mighty §YYuan§! dynasty, the domain of §YKublai Khan§!, has been entirely driven out of §YChina§! and retreated back to the steppe in shame. Though §YMongolia§! still claims the Yuan Emperorship, the §YMandate of Heaven§! has shifted to the §YMing§!, who seized power in the midst of a mass uprising against Mongol rule.\n\nToday the Mongol Khan cannot even claim to rule the steppe, or even to rule independently. Most of Mongolia has fallen under the sway of a new Mongol power: the §YOirat Confederation§! led by §YEsen Taishi§!. Esen has great ambitions; refusing to pay tribute to the Ming, he is willing to fight their vast armies in a bid for dominance. If Esen were not such a brilliant military commander the Western Mongols would be unlikely to accept such brash posturing.\n\n§YKhan Unebolad§! of the §YKorchin§! Mongols has carved out a respectable domain in Eastern Mongolia. He too has grand ambitions to reunite the Mongols, though his armies and abilities are more of a match for the divided Jurchens to the east than the consolidated forces of the Oirats.\n\nThe §YChagatai Khanate§! is the most stable of the Mongol successor states, though this does not hold it to a high standard. The §YChagatayids§! retain control over the land north of the §YTian Shan§! mountains, as well as over the §YYarkand Emirate§! of the Tarim Basin.\n\nMany among the Mongols have adopted the §YVajrayana§! faith, the §YTibetan§! sect of Buddhism. For the last several centuries this faith has coexisted peacefully with traditional Mongol belief in §YTengri§!, and the faith was even favored for a time under the Yuan. The Mongols must consider carefully their relations with §YTibet§! and decide on how to deal with the matter of religion.\n\nEvery Khan dreams of bringing unity to the Mongols and restoring Genghis Khan’s great Mongol Empire. Thus far all who have tried have had only short-lived success. But there is still time for a new Khan to rise to the challenge..."
 string_start_philippines:0 "In [GetYear] the Philippine islands are home to a number of small seafaring city states. The islands have always been distant enough to preserve their autonomy even in the face of strong hegemons like the former Srivijaya empire or the muslim Sultanates of §YBrunei§! and §YMalacca§!.\n\nInstead the archipelago has developed into a microcosm of indianized, sinophile and islamicized kingdoms, each with their own character and background.\n\nIn the north, on the island of Luzon, the city states of §YPangasinan§! and §YTondo§! thrive on the trade with the §YEmpire of China§!. Their status as tributaries allows them to gather Chinese goods for resale to the other islands. To this end the small Islamic city state of §YMaynila§!, has entered into close cooperation with Tondo. The latter acts as a port towards the Chinese while the former is the central point for the spreading of Chinese goods to the other islands.\n\nFurther south, in the Visayan archipelago, a number of Hindu settlements are competing to control the trade routes. The island kingdom of §YCebu§! is perhaps the oldest state in the region. The Cebu rulers claim the legacy of a prince of the Indian §YChola§! Empire. Many of the other states have entered into the federation of §YMadyas§!, a loose organization where each member takes turns to assume leadership over the others.\n\nWhile the old Hindu Rajahnate of §YButuan§! has traditionally held the upper hand in the far south it has recently had increasing competition from the Muslim oriented states of §YMaguindanao§! and §YSulu§!. Sulu has all but entered the sphere of the Muslim Sultanate of Brunei while Maguindanao has seen the royal family increasingly embracing islamic traditions over their traditional animist religion.\n\nSome would say that the divided nature of this rich archipelago at the turn of [GetYear] makes it vulnerable. Only time will tell if the Philippine microcosm can survive the arrival of new faiths, peoples and weapons."

The glory of §YChichen Itza§! has waned, and the last of the §YItza§! rulers have been forced to flee into the jungles, at the southern edge of §YYucatan§!, to build new cities. In its stead only one last §YMayan§! empire remained to hold the Yucatan together: the §YLeague of Mayapan§!. In 1441, however, the §YXiu§! rulers of §YUxmal§! broke free of the League, slaughtering the entire §YCocomes§! ruling family of Mayapan, save for one survivor. Returning to Yucatan, that survivor rallied his allies, and founded a new capital at §YSotuta§!, while the Xiu moved theirs to Mani. With their bitter rivalry, the last ties holding Yucatan together have fallen apart, and other polities, like §YChactemal§! and §YCan Pech§! are striking out on their own, rejecting the influence of the great dynasties of ancient Yucatan.\n\nFurther south, in the mountains of §YGuatemala§!, little is left of the once-great cities in the region. Only two significant powers remain: the chief of them is §YQumarkaj§!, capital of the §YKiche§! people, which united much of the highlands over generations of rulers. Much of the Kiche's power rests on their alliance with their powerful vassals, the §YKaqchikel§!. So long as they stand together, they are powerful, but should event divide them, let alone turn on each other, the Kiche's power would be greatly diminished. Nearby, the §YCh'orti§! people, the heirs to the once-great city of §YCopan§!, largely stay out of the politics of their neighbors, while in the mountain valleys of §YChiapas§!, a plethora of local Mayan people, like the §YTzotzil§!, remain largely ignored by the more powerful realms around them. North of the Chiapas, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the last descendants of the §YOlmec§! people, the §YYokot'an§!, likewise keep to their land, though they maintain a brisk trade with their neighbors.\n\nBut not all Mayan people live in the regions surrounding the Yucatan. Far to the north, beyond the lands of the Nahuatl people, the §YHuastec§! people left Mayan country thousands of years ago, driven north by the pressure of the then-nascent, now-forgotten Olmec Empire. They dwell now in the forest jungles at the northeastern edge of Mesoamerica, beyond the great empires of central Mexico.

The powerful groups that deposed the boy king once do not seem disposed to accept him a second time. They may well let their dynamic Hungarian regent Janos Hunyadi lead them instead.\n\nThe dream of a Habsburg Emperor was not lost with Albert. Upon his death, Frederick, the Austrian regent, was elected to lead the Holy Roman Empire. As the first of his family to sit on the Imperial throne Frederick will leave a legacy for future Habsburgs. Should they choose to pursue his careful policies of diplomatic marriages and patient inheritance planning, the Habsburgs may well build up a position of power unlike that of any family among the kings of Europe. The responsibilities of Imperial rule are great obstacles in themselves.

What remains of the Moorish presence in Iberia is now restricted to the southern kingdom of §YGranada§!, still a rich Muslim sultanate in many ways but also marred by infighting and the frequent border skirmishes with Christian raiders.

The Castilian Nobles and the local Cortes of the various constituent kingdoms still hold a large degree of power and many Trastámara kings have found themselves at the mercy of the estates of their kingdoms. Factions acting entirely out of their own interests have not shied away from supporting foreign pretenders from §YPortugal§! and §YAragon§! in the past.\n\nIf the kingdom can be united by a strong ruler, and the Reconquista completed, Castile will have a fearsome military force in its hands with a long tradition of fighting for the expansion of the Christian faith.

Aragon’s §YConsulate of the Sea§! aims to regulate and administrate all trade in the region, while Catalan and Valencian merchants struggle against merchants from §YGenoa§! and §YTuscany§! to control the flow of profit.

Nowhere are the knightly ideals of the late middle ages as alive as in Burgundy, with great tournaments, grand feasts, and of course the Order of the Golden Fleece itself. A knightly order created by the Duke, aspiring to recreate the knighthood of the Arthurian legends or Greek myths. The Burgundian court also dominates fashion and art, with fortunes being spent on silk, paintings and fantastic illuminated manuscripts.\n\nThe Duchy of Burgundy already rival many kingdoms in influence, income and even military might. By playing off the English and French against each other the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time.

As Afonso grows older however other forces at court will try to control him, hoping to use the young king for their own designs.\n\nWhile Castile has had a series of weak rulers and strong nobles, the Castilians can be a serious threat to the Portuguese.

Even the Christian empire of §YEthiopia§! must be attentive to the word of the Mamluk Sultan, as the Coptic pope, the ordainer of all Ethiopian bishops, is under Mamluk care.\n\nThe Mamluk amirs reproduce their ranks by purchasing new mamluks, foreign slaves mostly of Circassian origin. These slaves are then trained as soldiers or stewards, who all swear allegiance to their buyer, or 'foster-father'. The amirs in turn put their household to use in the service of the sultans. When the time for succession comes it is in practice the will of these powerful men that determines which amir will become the next sultan. This system ensures that the sultanate is never short of elite warriors, so long as the route to import more slaves from the Black Sea lies open. However, as a governing system it has more than once lead to damaging conflicts and paralyzing factionalism.\n\nThe future looks bright for the Mamluk Sultanate however, as the death of Timur has removed the greatest threat in the region, with the once expansive §YTimurid§!

While the Grand Principality of Muscovy is not the oldest of these states it has recently grown to be the strongest.

The empire spanned from §YSindh§! to §YBengal§!, from §YKashmir§! to the §YCoromandel Coast§!.\n\nThe Tughlaq empire collapsed as quickly as it rose to power. Though it is a Muslim state ruling over many millions of Hindus, its downfall was orchestrated by ambitious Muslim generals rather than popular Hindu resistance. In 1347 the entirety of southern §YIndia§! was lost in the revolt of general Ala-ud-Din Hasan Bahman Shah, who declared himself ruler of the new Sultanate of §YBahmanis§!.\n\nMore recently, the Sultanate suffered a catastrophic blow when the §YSharqi§! governors of §YJaunpur§! broke away in 1394, taking with them a vast stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and reducing the Sultanate's influence to an area barely beyond the city walls. Mahmud Shah, Sultan of Jaunpur, eyes his neighbors hungrily; he has designs not only on the throne of Delhi, but also on the nearby Bengal Sultanate and the §YGajapati§! Kingdom of §YOrissa§!. The Sultan's ambitions threaten to engulf all of northern India.\n\nThe final nail in the Tughlaq's coffin came with the brutal §YTimurid§! invasion in 1398. The fearsome warlord had no intention of beginning a conquest of India, instead setting his armies to loot and burn and massacre all that they laid eyes upon. In the midst of the chaos, the Tughlaq dynasty was finally overthrown by the §YSayyid§! governors of Delhi. The upstart Sayyids have thus far entirely failed to put an end to the catastrophe facing the Sultanate. Only the Rajputs of §YJangladesh§! remain truly loyal to the Sultan in this period of ruin.\n\nJust as the Sayyids rose from governors to Sultans, another powerful governor has risen in §YSirhind§!. Bahlul Lodi, an Afghan noble, is an extremely adept governor and military leader. His control of the §YPunjab§! gives him a dangerous degree of power, which he is likely to leverage in a bid to seize control of Delhi itself.

In 1347 the §YBahmanis§! Sultanate won its independence from Delhi and has since become a power in its own right.

Rich in economic assets, among others the fabled diamond mines of Golconda, the Sultans are now wealthier than most kings. Their court, and its fabled Turquoise throne, is famous beyond the subcontinent. Fame that greatly helps to attract the greedy and gifted from the wider Muslim world.\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate is also a troubled state. Cutting ties with the north has meant that it is without direct access to the west. At the same time the kingdom has a much smaller Muslim minority than most northern Sultanates and in its isolation even the most persianate of nobles have begun to adopt local culture and language. Newcomers and indigenized nobles often end up in conflict with each other and the new capital of Bidar has been built partly to avoid the intrigues of the old one in Gulbarga.\n\nNot far from the kingdom's southern border lies the City of Victory, §YVijayanagar§!. The city is the seat of the Sangama Rajas, and with its 400 000 inhabitants it is a very different place from the orderly fort city of Bidar. This is the capital of an Empire that stretches across Southern India and that has recently conquered almost the entire Tamil country in the far south. Vijayanagar is a formidable rival to Bahmani power, and has continued to advance on the contested zone between the two kingdoms.

In short succession Kapilendra has won a number of great victories, each seemingly more unlikely than the next. Having defeated Jaunpur, Bengal, the Bahmanis and Vijayanagar in various regional conflicts, he is now greedily eyeing Telingana and the Andhran coastline. With 18 legitimate sons, Kapilendra must act prudently to avoid all his great conquests being lost upon his death.\n\nIn the central Deccani upland the §YBahmani§! Sultanate has been free of Delhi's overlordship for almost 100 years. The Sultans are rich beyond the wildest dreams of the people in their old homelands in Iran, Transoxiana and Arabia, yet they are also the masters of a state far from the entrenched Muslim aristocrats of northern India. Cut off from the north, the state has become dependent on immigration from the Muslim west as well as the acquisition of foreign war horses from overseas. The recent loss of the western coastline is, therefore, a catastrophe for the Sultanate, and steps have been taken to expand to the eastern coast instead, interfering in the internal politics of the Velamas of §YTelingana§! as well as the Reddys of §YAndhra§!.\n\nJust a short distance from the Bahmani capital in §YBidar§! lies §YVijayanagar§!, the 'City of Victory' and the capital of their main adversary.

With German aid gained from marching against the Magyars, the Přemyslids sidelined their own nobility, and struck a powerful blow in 995 that significantly centralised their power.\n\nThe year 1002 marked a turning point for Bohemia, its lands enfeoffed to §YDuke Vladivoj§!, finally integrating the duchy into the Empire. The decades afterwards were marked with conflict against the northern pagans, being humiliated in the 1055 invasion of Silesia that resulted in the duke's death. After this, Bohemia entered into a period of relative peace and prosperity, hailed by some as its golden age of culture and development. The dynasty of the Carolingians and Přemyslids became further intertwined with a series of politically convenient royal marriages, resulting in Ottokar I being named the hereditary §YKing of Bohemia§! in 1198. This was only further affirmed by the §YGolden Bull of Aachen in 1212§!, enshrining its status as a kingdom.\n\nThe Přemyslids were hated by many other European houses due to their ties with the Carolingians, and so the assassination of §YWenceslaus III in 1306§! ended the dynasty, with the §YHouse of Luxembourg§! quickly swooping in to take over. The §YGolden Bull of 1356§! turned Bohemia into an elector, increasing their power and prestige significantly. However, growing resentment and criticism of the church exploded into violent tension with the rising popularity of §YJan Hus§!, and his Hussite movement. The conflict lasted between 1419 to 1434, ending in the moderate Hussites accepting Bohemian rule and Catholic dominion, being allowed to practise their rites in peace.\n\nThe end of the war was marked by the election of a new dynasty, the §YHohenstaufen§! king Rudolph, younger brother of the Lotharingian king Frederick III. His unpopular reign is marked with the attempt to re-catholicize Bohemia and banish the Hussites. Though partly successful, they still hold major sway in the city of Prague itself, and while Rudolph has the estates on his side, Francia is once again falling apart at the seams, led by an incompetent emperor. Now Bohemia, as a nation and as a people, stand at the crossroads. Will they return to the Pope, or will they reject the authority of Rome, and adopt a second reformation? Will they fully integrate themselves with the Germans they have surrounded themselves with for centuries, or will they pridefully retain their cultures and traditions?"

The most prominent of these are §YDanzig§! and §YRiga§!. The Balts were cordial in their relations with these cities, as trade was beneficial to both sides, but lately, following religious upheaval in the §YHoly Roman Empire§!, they have been the destination of many far more zealous immigrants. Relations cooled until they finally became outright hostile. The people of the German outposts have been whipped into a religious frenzy and they are intent on bringing the Word of God to these heathen savages. \n \n The zealous Germans are intent on making the Balts give up their false gods and the Balts are determined to destroy the foreign invaders, like they have done many times before. The fate of the Baltic is unsure, and the future is uncertain.

The efforts of the legendary §YCharles Martel, Pepin the Short,§! and §YCharlemagne§! saw Francia’s rulers declared the Emperors of the Romans at the dawn of the 9th Century. Unfortunately, a vast slew of issues would begin to form rifts within the state. After the death of Charlemagne’s son §YLouis the Pious§! in AD 840, most Carolingian Emperors would begin their reigns with piling crises and crude territorial partitions, all the while in their forefathers’ shadows. §YCharles the Fat’s§! reign in the late 9th century brought a new time of troubles, and upon the succession of his son §YBernard I§! in AD 888, these cracks began to show.\n\nAt the end of Bernard’s shaky reign in AD 924, his sons Pepin, Charles, and Lothair plunged Francia into decades of civil war over their inheritance. Fearful of what would occur if the troubles in Francia spread across the Rhine, in AD 925 the nobles and clergy named Saxon duke §YOtto Liudolfinger§! as Emperor. To prevent a Carolingian resurgence, Emperor Otto and his successors did their utmost to curb Frankish influence and erode the Carolingian powerbase, splitting off §YLotharingia§! and §YArles§!. They were not destined for a place in the sun, however; just shy of a century after Otto’s usurpation, from §YAD 1014-1024§! the Ottonians were eclipsed by the very realm they sought to bring under heel, fading into the annals of history and their holdings reduced to cinders.\n\nAlthough the Carolingians regained the Emperorship, their misfortunes were far from over. In AD 1101, Emperor Charles V was forced to cede §YCalais§! to the English after a failed campaign to avenge 1066, and over the next several centuries, the emperors’ relationships with their Ducal subjects in Germany grew strained. This ultimately came to a head in AD 1356, when Emperor Lothair II capitulated to pressure and issued a §YGolden Bull§! in Aachen, establishing the Prince-Electorates at the cost of debasing Frankish prestige. Following this great humiliation were the §YHussite Wars§!, which ravaged Bohemia from AD 1419-1434, §Yending on uncertain terms§! with an unpopular king in Prague seated amidst a sea of secret heretics.\n\nNot even a decade later came the §YIberian Crusade§! of AD 1443 where, despite the full might of the Empire brought to bear, only ruin lay ahead. The war met its crescendo in the bloody §YBattle of Valencia§!, which proved to be a crushing blow against Christendom. §YEmperor Robert IV and his son lay dead§!, and the mortified Imperial armies recoiled in disbelief, withdrawing from Iberia. The Prince Electors naturally settled on §YLothair III§! of Francia, the last full-blooded descendant of Charlemagne, though his lack of issue bodes ill, while his poor character and post war concessions left his image in tatters. The final hours of the Carolingians may soon be dawning. Can Lothair save his bloodline and realm, or will he fall in the pursuit of Charlemagne’s fleeting glory like so many before?"
 string_start_lothar:0 "Lotharingia is a nation that should not exist. It was initially intended to be the inheritance of Louis the Pious’s the eldest son, Lothair. Then, Louis had another son, Charles the Bald and the plan for Lothair went up in smoke. Charles wanted Lotharingia for himself since he was far enough from the throne to not be presumed to sit in Paris. The resultant rebellion was mercifully cut short when the Emperor Louis died, and his second son Pepin died soon after. With the immediate family tree pruned so much, neither Lothair or Charles had much want to cut off more branches. So, when Lothair took the throne he did so as Emperor of all of Francia, keeping the Empire united from the North Sea to the Mediterranean. When Bernard, the son of Emperor Charles, who took over when Charles died, himself lay dying in 840 the Lotharingia plan was revived and the Kingdom was intended to be granted to his middle son Lothair who gave the kingdom its name.\n\nThe plan was put in jeopardy before Bernard even died. As the Emperor lay on his death bed his sons divided up the Empire. Charles rallied the Paris nobility to his side, Pepin fled to Lombardy and Lothair arrived in Lotharingia. The Francian Civil War immediately threatened to spill into Germany as Lothair, outnumbered and desperate, began to turn to the Princes of East Francia to support him in taking the Imperial throne. He failed and the Germans instead turned to one of their own, Otto Ludolfinger, to lead them. Otto then led a series of punitive wars against the Francians to secure German dominance and neuter Francian influence. Out of these wars Lotharingia was freed in 930, but not under the Carolingians. Instead Otto put the Nibelung’s in power, a German cadet branch of the Carolingians closer to the Germans than their cousins in Paris.\n\nLotharingia has managed to survive the tribulation of history, though rarely due to the talents of its King. During the uninspiring reign of Rudolf ‘the Cripple’ Nibelung in the 1200s, the Hohenstaufens, the rising rulers of Swabia, emerged as strong contenders to the throne. The nobles quickly gravitated to the more vigorous Hohenstaufen claimant and it wasn’t long before the Nibelung’s fled the Kingdom to avoid capture and possible execution. The Hohenstaufens however failed to be much more energetic on the world stage than the Nibelung’s and Lotharingia once more settled into a diplomatic stasis. At both times spewing grand proclamations of their might and power over their Francian neighbors while simultaneously doing whatever possible to keep the Francian armies from trodding their Kingdom into dust. It seems, for now, the Empire’s bulwark against Francian machinations has failed. However the fate of nations is infamously fickle. All it could take to turn the moribund state around is one ambitious and talented ruler. Come what may, something must be done, one way or another, lest the fate of Lotharingia be sealed forever by the force of time."

Oftentimes the Vlach Principalities have even existed simultaneously, albeit under different overlords altogether. That being said, Moldavia was generally the one dealt greater blows by its oppressors due to its closer proximity to the frontier between Christendom and the pagans. Facing raids and demands for tribute from Slavs, Magyars, Cumans, Mongols, and even a few rogue Hussites and Byzantine pretenders, there have been no shortage of struggles for this rugged people. \n \n At an earlier time than many, Moldavia broke from the yoke of the §YGreat Horde§! and only briefly remained under §YMagyar§! rule - much to the envy of the Wallachians. This did render them more vulnerable to incursions by §YSlavic§! raiders, on the other hand, and by the beginning of the 15th Century there was a significant Slavic minority within the Principality’s borders. Further troubles began when religious persecutions by pagans saw a vast influx of §YCatholic§! refugees into the primarily §YOrthodox§! state and - to top it all off - when the §YHussite§! heretics made their way to the Vlach principalities in a long and arduous trek, they began to cement themselves in communities and cliques much to the clergy’s even greater dismay. \n \n Moldavia is currently backed into a corner by its woes.

This period was a cultural golden age, as Moravia quickly became the cultural centre of the Slavic world.\n\nMoravia reached the height of its power during the reign of §YSvatopluk§! in the late 9th century. Svatopluk ended the cultural golden age by expelling the theologians educated by §YConstantine§! and §YMethodius§!, thus bringing the country under the Bishop of Rome’s jurisdiction. Svatopluk was proclaimed §Y’Rex Sclavorum’§! by the Pope, and with his blessing, he subjugated the surrounding Slavic tribes, becoming the undisputed regional hegemon.\n\nHowever, this did not last long. Following Svatopluk’s death, the throne in Veligrad was claimed by his eldest son §YMojmír II§!, whose reign saw the disintegration of the empire which Svatopluk had spent his life building.

It would be fair to say that the Antiochians were reliant on the §YAngevins§! of Jerusalem and later the §YLusignans§! of Cyprus for their own survival.\n\n All that being said, Antioch is not without its saving graces. To its north lie the §YTurkish Beyliks§!, which have been atrophying under their constant wars with the fragments of the Eastern Roman Empire. To its west lies the even weaker Cyprus, and the vast Mediterranean Sea - across which the Princes’ primary benefactor §YVenice§! lies with its formidable merchant fleet. To the south and east, however, lie the true prizes. The Levant and Mesopotamia; the Fertile Crescent and all its resources. While currently controlled by the fearsome §YNizzarid Sultanate§!, it would only take a single successful campaign to shift the balance of power in favour of the House of Poitiers.

 string_start_title_cyprus:0 "The Kingdom of Cyprus"
 string_start_cyprus:0 "The Kingdom of Cyprus is an oddity among the last remaining Crusader States of the Near East. There is a certain lack of prestige surrounding the title of King of Cyprus due to how short-lived it is. The realm was established after the §YThird Crusade§!, rather than in the wake of the First like its mainland Latin neighbours of §YAntioch§! and §YJerusalem§!. To top it all off, the Kingdom of Cyprus had its roots in betrayal and bloodshed not from a Saracen, but from fellow Christians serving a renegade Byzantine governor. When the dust had settled and the corrupt Komnenid noble was deposed by a shipwrecked fleet, the Crusaders set up Cyprus as both a forward operating base and a fallback point under Jerusalem’s control, should the Levant fall to Saracen advances. \n \n Cyprus’ future was set on a course nobody could have predicted following decades of trouble with the §YLusignan§! dynasty, as King §YBaudouin the Great§! saw to stop them crawling around in the shadows and putting Jerusalem’s survival in jeopardy. Thus, the majority of the House of Lusignan was exiled to the island of Cyprus to keep them out of government affairs. When Amalric de Lusignan sailed with most of his family to Cyprus in 1202 just about everybody expected them to be tonsured, not for the local nobility to be manipulated into placing this disgraced family on the governor’s chair. When Lusignan nobles still serving in the Jerusalemite court took over the regency for the young King §YGeoffrei I§! of Jerusalem in 1291, Cyprus’ governor Henri de Lusignan saw fit to exploit the realm’s growing instability and corruption to his fullest advantage. Declaring independence as Lord of the Cypriots in 1292, Governor Henri crowned himself King of Cyprus in 1293. Despite sending many protests and threats, there was nothing Jerusalem could do. \n \n The Lusignan Kings of Cyprus are a lineage of politicians, schemers, and diplomats, so it was only natural for them to have reached out to both §YVenice§! and Antioch for protection, although even the Angevin Kings of Jerusalem were willing to cooperate after a few decades of standoffs. Perhaps they were simply relieved to have the Lusignans off their backs, though nobody truly knows. Whatever the case, the future of this small Crusader State may be secure from a number of outside threats, but it is the interior which has begun to cause problems. Much like Antioch, Cyprus’ population are primarily Orthodox Christians, who are embittered by the evermore elitist Catholic ruling class. To add further insult to injury, the native Greek population has not taken kindly to being sidelined in favour of foreigners - especially the Latins who betrayed the Emperor in Constantinople in 1204. If the King of Cyprus is to look outwards and secure a foothold in the Holy Land, he must first look within and stop the flames of revolt from being fanned. Should Cyprus fail in this, the youngest Crusader State may also be the first to fall since Tripoli..."

With their own king, §YHarald Hardrada§!, dead alongside much of his retinue, the Yngling dynasty were forced to relinquish their claim to the English throne, returning home defeated and bloodied, yet also humbled. Unfortunately, Norway's troubles only grew worse from this point, as her neighbouring Scandinavian kingdoms were eyeing up what may prove an easy conquest.\n\nAlthough Norway had remained largely at peace for some time after their defeat at English hands, it was unfortunately faced with both Danish and Swedish hostility for many decades. The Danes were still clinging onto an ephemeral hope that they could reclaim §YCnut the Great's North Sea Empire§!, having only been dissolved for several decades. Meanwhile, Sweden had been facing a constant influx of §YChristian§! refugees fleeing Danish and Norwegian persecution, and did not take kindly to the continued attacks on their own flock.\n\nBy sheer luck or the intervention of the Aesir, however, the kingdom remained in relative peace despite all of its external woes. That was, at least, until 1130, when King §YSigurd Magnusson's§! death permitted a multitude of claimants to begin tearing the kingdom apart in order to seize the throne. Due to the lack of defined succession laws, this period of constant warfare persisted for several decades, only abating when the Christian Swedes commenced a full-scale invasion of the Norse realm.\n\nIndeed, this §Y'Northern Crusade'§!, as it had been dubbed by German chroniclers, was a bloody affair, with the Swedes tearing through the land and sacking whatever they could in the name of expanding the Cross' influence to the Norse heathenry. In a stroke of luck for the beleaguered Norwegians, though, the Swedes had failed to take advantage of Divide and Conquer strategy. Rather than exploit the multitude of warlords and play them off each other, the Crusaders instead settled for killing or converting as many as they could.\n\nThis ultimately allowed the Norwegian pretender, §YMagnus Erlingsson§!, to consolidate his rule in the north and west, becoming the sole king of Norway in 1164. From there, he would defeat a number of Swedish incursions, but was on the defensive until the 1180s. His lucky break arrived in the form of word that the Danes were invading Sweden, meaning that the bulk of the Crusader force had to be diverted away from Norway. Exploiting their now-greatly decreased numbers, Magnus was able to capture the Swedish king, and force a withdrawal.\n\nIt was from this point onwards that Norway had truly stabilised itself, with the implementation of clear succession laws, and the death or surrender of most rival warlords. By the turn of the century, Norway had reached a status quo which it finds itself in to this day. Alas, her age-old rivals of Sweden and Denmark are gearing up for war again, the time to remind the world of §YViking§! terror may soon be at hand."

While this was a disgraceful defeat, Alexander III faced larger threats from within his own kingdom. While his house, Dunkeld, had united the Gaelic north and Scottish south, the twin sides of his realm threatened to tear each other apart, and he spent the rest of his days in court settling disputes and managing alliances while raising his son, Alexander IV of Clan Dunkeld.\n\nMeanwhile, a revolution was taking place. Monastic reform, brought about through the influence of the Catholic Church, brought Scotland closer and closer into the European sphere of influence; thus it was referred to as the “Monk’s Revolution.” This revolution also brought with it an influx of Anglo-Saxon nobles, fleeing the anarchy, into the provinces of Lothian and the lowlands in general. They integrated comfortably with the Scots, but only increased tensions with the northern Gaelic clans, as they attempted to wrest power from their control. The situation escalated with the English Conquest of Strathclyde in the year 1321, a 5 year conflict that ended with a decisive Scottish defeat.\n\nIt is the year 1444, and Scotland stands at a crossroads. The aging Alexander V believes in a united kingdom; he believes in a land that unites the Scots, the Anglo-Saxons, the Gaelic clans, and all peoples of Albion, but he knows many are unfaithful in this dream. The battle lines are being drawn in court, country, and clans. Scotland will forever change in the coming century, and Alexander believes his heir, Edgar II, is the one to see this change through. He is a meek and timid boy, but he shall grow into the lion the kingdom needs him to become. Be it a High King of the Gaels, the Lord of the Scots, or the King of Albion, his subjects wait in anticipation with bated breaths to witness the transformation of Edgar as well as the Kingdom of Scotland, for better or for worse."

Alas, such optimism was rapidly dashed against the rocks of the Golden Horn. Despite facing a crisis which may have seen them hanged from the §YTheodosian Walls§!, the §YAngelid§! dynasty nonetheless proved themselves utterly incapable of anything short of malicious negligence and gross mismanagement of the Eastern Roman Empire. With nothing but the most opulent degeneracy on full display and never a care in the world, the House of Angelos was quickly taken advantage of by the aristocracy.\n\nHaving maintained their useless emperors as figureheads, the Constantinopolitan clique would further advance the Byzantine nosedive, filling their coffers while the people starved and fled eastwards. Even against the threat of §YBulgarian§! invasion in the 13th century, the imperial regime did nothing in response. Yet, when §YLeon Gabras§! took up arms and saved the empire, he was hastily banished to a governorship in Anatolia. With an impending §YTurkish§! invasion, it was expected that he would perish, no longer posing a threat to the machinations of the political elite. This assumption proved false, and the Saviour of Thrace declared unilateral independence from Constantinople and from the Empire, having concluded that the Roman dream was long dead.\n\nThe Imperial court was utterly livid at the secession of the Anatolian provinces, but even if they wanted to launch a war of reclamation, this was impossible; in order to skim more money off the budget, the chancellor had disbanded the Imperial Army in AD 1294. In its place, a truly unreliable mercenary force was instituted. This warband preferred plundering Byzantine lands to protecting them, however, greatly reducing imperial rule in the countryside. Left with no army of its own and a plummeting economic situation, the Byzantine Empire would then be forced to mothball its fleet, culminating in Venice seeping into the Aegean in the 1300s with the help of an Epirote rebellion under the disgruntled §YPalaiologos§! family.\n\nThe complete failure of the government in Constantinople to maintain even a shred of legitimacy and influence would end in one of the worst military blunders in Roman history. At the dawn of the 15th Century, the empire would attempt to assert its hegemony over the Bulgar Empire, despite lacking a proper military, resulting in the rapid loss of §YMacedonia§! and §YWestern Thrace§! to a miniscule §YBulgarian§! detachment. Mere decades have passed since the Humiliation of Thessalonica, and Constantinople is in shambles; the city's population numbers at a meagre 20,000 and is in total disrepair.

His greatest accomplishment was yet to come, however, for the vast armies of the §YBulgarian Empire§! would soon come pouring in from the north, overwhelming much of Thrace and Macedonia by the end of AD 1261.\n\nRallying anyone he could under the flags of the Byzantine Empire and the House of Gabras, Leon would make his stand at the ruins of Pella, where his forces would defeat and rout the Czar's army. Despite saving the realm, an act which had earnt him the epithet of Soter - Saviour - Leon Gabras was hastily exiled to a governorship in §YAnatolia§! by the Angelid court, whose jealousy and paranoia were nearing the breaking point.\n\nIn the Spring of AD 1267, when Western Anatolia found itself beset by another wave of Turkish incursions, Leon Gabras was left to fend off an overwhelming enemy force alone for a second time, scoring yet another stunning victory. When news reached the capital, the court responded by §Ycharging the Megas Strategos with High Treason against the Church and People of Rome§!, demanding that he fall on his sword, or to stand trial in Constantinople.\n\nUtterly disillusioned by this crushing betrayal, Leon Gabras became convinced that the Roman dream was long dead, having morphed into a malignant rot. A grand mutiny followed in AD 1269, when Nicaea declared unilateral independence from Constantinople, followed soon thereafter by most Greek-held territories east of the Hellespont, save for several Imperial strongholds along the coast.\n\nThe ruling military governors had been longtime friends of Leon Gabras through correspondence, thus a strong martial bond forged the core of the §YHellenic Kingdom of Nicaea§!.

Foolishly, the Greeks failed to note in their records and almanacks the anguish of the serf and the humiliation of the noble, whose resentment would only build with time, waxing as Roman power waned.\n\nTheir doom would arise by their own hand, as Boyars upon the border of Asia Minor schemed away from the nosy meddling of the court.

Though a meagre few have come close to destroying Persia, the Sasanians almost met their match when they bore the brunt of rapid Islamic invasions out of Arabia in the 7th Century - a series of conflicts immediately following an already crippling war with the Byzantines. \n \n Yazdegerd III, King of Kings, proved ineffective in his rule as the Persian Empire built by the great Sasan crumbled. No greater echoing of this spiral into oblivion could be seen but for the capital Ctesiphon’s swift capture and sacking at the hands of the Islamic forces in 637 AD. With barely even a hastily-drafted levy as the remainder of the Persian army, Yazdegerd’s sole saving grace was his foresight in evacuating most of the treasury from the capital as his court abandoned the west. The additional funding it provided allowed for bolstered ranks and better equipment when the Persian forces decisively routed the Caliphate at the Battle of Nahavand. The Sasanian victory against the Caliphate allowed their thinned garrisons to maintain the central territories behind the Zagros, albeit at the cost of the treacherous Caspian satraps seceding upon realising their liege was incapable of retaliation. Though central Persia was consolidated, the Shahanshah’s satraps proved ineffective at preserving southern Persia - particularly the birthplace of the Achaemenid dynasty in Fars - which fell with minimal organised resistance. \n \n As the centuries passed, the Sacred Fires in the north were the only ones to remain alight; Islam had entrenched itself in much of Western and Central Asia. The westward invasions of the bloodthirsty Mongols and the Turkic Seljuks and Timurids over the years would have little effect on the isolationist Persians in the north, as the mountainous natural borders would prove to be their best defence, complementing the hit-and-run tactics of the new Sasanian army. Recently Timurid influence has begun to wane as their state enters its death throes, whilst the Nizzarids peer towards the imminent power vacuum with great interest.

Elected as king by the Burgundian nobles of Dijon in protest against Charles the Fat's illegitimate son Bernad's accession to the imperial throne. The two would come into conflict over the Middle Frankish lands, with Bernard winning, although allowing Rudolph to keep his title of King of Upper Burgundy, so long as he renounced his claims on Lotharingia proper.\n\nRudolph would rule a middling realm centered in Upper Burgundy for the rest of his life, leaving his holdings to his son Rudolph II, who spent much of his time battling for supremacy over Italy. Rudolph II in turn left his domains to his own son Conrad in 937. Conrad would then exploit the ongoing Carolingian-Ottonian wars and was granted the kingdom of Provence in 940 from the declining Bosonids by the Franks, in exchange for his support against the Germans. With the two Burgundies unified, Conrad crowned himself king of Arles in 941.\n\nThis kingdom would not last however, and Conrad's son, the weak willed Rudolph III would cause the new kingdom to split once again. Struggling to hold off external invasion as well as the powerful Burgundian magnates, Rudolph III's reign would see a shrinking of external influence and an almost complete collapse of royal power outside of Arles itself. Rudolph III's death in 1032 left power in the hands of 4 sons, fighting for power over a dwindling domain.\n\nThis fracturing of the kingdom would continue throughout the middle ages, with power largely divided along the old Burgundian and Provencal boundaries. With Upper Burgundy retaining more power and wealth from intercontinental trade, while Lower Burgundy struggled under Saracen raids and Genoese economic domination, which only ended with strong leadership of Otto the handsome in the early 14th century. Hailing from Lower Burgundy, his victories over Berber pirates and the Genoese in 1375 and 1376 respectively allowed him to amass enough wealth to conquer Upper Burgundy, unifying the two kingdoms. This new unification would culminate with the glorious reign of Otto the Just, starting in 1434. Under him, the court of Arles was renowned for its chivalrous traditions, fair maidens, and powerful knights. Yet Otto the Just's death in Barcelona in 1444 would bring about a new era of disunity to the realm. Now split in two once again. Otto’s bastard child Conrad, calling himself Otto IV, disputes the succession from Dijon in Upper Burgundy. While the legitimate son Conrad II in Lower Burgundy desires unification.

 string_start_bavaria:0 "Established in the §Y500s§!, Bavaria was a consistent trouble spot for the Franks, with §YCharlemagne§! himself even having to personally crush a revolt in the Duchy in the late §Y700s§!. When East Francia collapsed Bavaria was once more subject to warfare as the expansionist §YMagyars§! crossed into South Germany. The locally known Magyar Wars were savage but culminated in §YDuke Luitpold§! routing the Magyars at §YPressburg§!. The further disintegration of Carolingian power in Germany led to the rise of the §YOttonians§! in the §Y930s§!. The Bavarians used this period of relative peace to develop their lands, becoming one of the most prosperous regions in all of Germany. From §Y1014 to 1024§!, Saxony was ravaged by vengeful Carolingian armies, leading to a feudal reorganisation across the Empire. In this shuffle, Bavaria fell under the sway of the surging §YStyrian Babenberg§! dynasty, remaining as the crown jewel of the ducal house until a coalition of Swabians and Lombards, led by §YFriedrich Barbarossa§!, marched against Styria to support the §YHabsburg§! rebellion in Tirol.\n\nAfter a series of severe defeats at the hands of the Barbarossa, the Munich-based §YWittelsbach§! dynasty saw their chance to escape the Styrian yoke and rose in revolt. The rebel armies penetrated Styria itself, making a rush for §YGraz§! alongside the Swabian duke, hastening the Babenbergs’ final defeat. Impressed, Friedrich Barbarossa granted rule of Bavaria to the Witteslbachs in return for their fealty. However, it wasn’t long before the newly minted dukes of Bavaria chafed under their Swabian overlords. When Barbarossa marched on Crusade in his twilight years and left the vast §YHohenstaufen§! realm to be divided amongst his house, the Bavarians soon thereafter declared their independence. Insisting their oath was only to Barbarossa, not his heirs or successors, a divided Swabia was unable to challenge such assertions.\n\nFree for the first time in centuries, the Bavarian dukes began to dream of a §YSouth German Kingdom§! from which they could unite the Empire against Carolingian and Hohenstaufen tyranny. Their plans, however, have been met with multiple delays. The dangerous §YHussite§! heresy in neighbouring Bohemia forced the Bavarians to respond, and at the outbreak of the §YHussite Wars§!, Bavaria’s soldiers earnt themselves a fearsome reputation for their skill and bravery, and only a few years later, they fought valiantly at the Imperial army’s crushing last stand at §YValencia in 1443§!.\n\nIt is now 1444 and the Wittelsbach are in a precarious position. Their armies have still yet to recover from the Iberian disaster and the ever cutthroat politics of South Germany are once more in transition. New houses like the Habsburgs of Tirol and old powers like the Salians of Franconia and Swabian Hohenstaufens each vie for a leg up over their competition. At the same time, the Babenburgs in Styria hungrily eye their lost possessions. If Bavaria’s ultimate dream of a unified South Germany is to be achieved, they must move quickly, lest they be outmanoeuvred and consigned to the dustbin of history."

However, their wish would be granted after the Franks deposed the Saxon usurper §YHenrich II§!. Seeking an ally to counteract the formerly Saxon-aligned house of §YHohenstaufen§! in Swabia, Styria was granted ducal powers by the emperor in §Y1018§!. After Francia commenced its §YHarrying of the North§!, Germany descended into chaos. The entire realm was swept up in a series of devastating, albeit contained, wars known as the §YKleinenkreige§!, during which the Babenburgs sought to come out ahead of their old Hohenstaufen rivals.\n\nTirol was subjugated, if only briefly, by Styria in §Y1020§!, and Bavaria was awarded to them by Francia not long after. By §Y1025§! the Babenberger realm was one of the strongest in not just the south, but the Empire as a whole. Now at the peak of their power, the Styrians seemed unstoppable, but all it took was a single calamity for it all to fall apart. In §Y1049§!, the scheming §YWerner III von Habsburg§!, longtime lord of Tirol under Graz, refused an urgent summons by the Styrian duke Heinrich III von Babenberg. In retaliation, the duke attacked Tirol, and before long his armies were camped around Innsbruck, unaware that the Habsburg count had reached out to §YFriedrich Barbarossa§! for help. Within mere weeks, Swabian and Lombard forces had entered the Babenberg realm.\n\nThe mountain fighting was hard and Barbarossa, a legendary tactician, was able to outmanoeuvre and overwhelm the Styrians in nearly every battle. As Duke Heinrich fell back into Styria itself, the opportunistic Bavarian magnates, under the §YWittelsbachs of Munich§!, rose against him and invaded Northern Styria. With the Swabians, Tirolians and Lombards pushing from the South and Bavarians swapping down from the North, defeat was clearly inevitable. In late §Y1053§! the Peace of Graz was signed, the terms of which were harsh for the defeated Babenbergs; Tirol was split off and swore fealty to Swabia, while Bavaria was also freed and granted to the upstart Wittelsbachs, and the Duke of Styria was left in mountains of debt. The duchy which once was a byword for opulence and prosperity was in ruins.\n\nThe Babenburgs, however, were patient in their revenge. For the next four centuries they sat in their duchy and built it up once more into a centre of culture, learning and wealth to envy any other in Europe. Meanwhile they trained and drilled their armies relentlessly, to a deadly professionalism. Then, they waited. They waited as Barbarossa galavanted through the Holy Land and abdicated his throne. They waited as Bavaria broke free once more. They waited as the Hussites and Andalusians threatened to tear the Empire apart. The world may soon destroy itself more spectacularly than the Babenbergs could hope, and from the ruins, may Styria rise again."

His decision to empower Lombardy for their loyalty, among others, let the Italian kingdom remain in relevance as they freely pledged their allegiance to the §YOttonian§! dynasty that came to power in the Carolingian ruins. With weak, decentralised rule to the west, they seized the rich region of §YMonferrato§! without much issue, before turning their gaze towards the merchants of §YVenice§!. What ensued was a bloody four-year-long war between §Y953-957§!, from Pavia to Treviso, pushing the Venetians back to their impregnable city. With the §YPo Valley§! under control, Lombardy reigned uncontested but overextended in bureaucracy, while Venice quietly and bitterly recovered, while the city-states of northern Italy began to form into coherent, stable countries.\n\nAfter a century of §YSaxon§! rule, the Carolingians returned.

In the aftermath, what settled was an unspoken truce - for fear of causing an endless cycle of warfare.\n\nIn §Y1168§!, the last Lombardian King was shot through the throat as the Swabian coalition ended §YStyrian§! aggression, and with no heir apparent, the influential §YVisconti§! family swiftly wrestled control. Thereafter the kingdom abstained from almost all conflicts not relevant to their direct interests, sending only a small contingent of mercenaries in the §Y1352§! coalition against Sicily, and periodically engaging in minor border skirmishes with the other city-states. This long stretch of peace led to a swing in prosperity and growth, and Lombardy's coffers were full enough to buy the §YIron Crown§! that Francia pawned off to them following their disastrous §YCrusade against Andalusia§!, which had left them heavily debt-ridden.\n\nBy 1444, Lombardy stood rich and powerful, the Iron Crown bestowing them an air of opulence. Their neighbours remain fractured and divided, and though the merchants of Venice are still a threat, the kingdom is prepared once more to reclaim their once-held glory. Not only that, but rumours in the court float of the Visconti aiming not only to be kings in Italy, but rather Kings of Italy, as Francia's weak authority and unpopular ruler allow Lombardy to once again strike with impunity."

 string_start_hansa:0 "The Hanseatic League known as the Hansa for short. Has until recently been a loose association of German merchants, with kantors as far east as the Baltic to as West as Lunden. It was founded by the two free cities of Bremen and Hamburg who sought new trade opportunities even with people not friendly with the Empire such as Pagan Slavs and Danes, and the Anglo-Saxons. To better facilitate trade, and expand their influence, The Hansa had overtime arranged for the foundation of a series of towns across Pagan occupied lands. These small towns would grow to be the city states of Lubeck, Danzig, and Riga.\n \nAlways eager for new converts since conflicts against the Pagans had largely remained border skirmishes, the Local bishops of Bremen sought to use these new towns to spread the word of the lord and helped provide funding for them. This would create a conflict of interest turned bloody, the so-called Wesser War, which was mainly a series of low-level ground skirmishes and several naval battles that ended inconclusively. \n \nOf the three new cities Danzig and Riga began to be dominated by the it’s clergy eventually leading to the creation of the Bishopric of Riga, while Danzig became a base for the Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem later known as the Teutonic Knights. Lubeck had managed to remain a republic with little influence from the Church but cut off from Hamburg and Bremen.\n \nThis loss of cohesion from the Hanseatic cities, as well as increasing conflicts across Saxony saw Hamburg and Bremen unite in a system of rotating elections and pooled levy and naval strength. As the Hansa had maintained its trade routes with the Norse it had long heard tales of a land with wine across the sea.

Their Dukes were ambitious of course, but so were all the others. However, the §YLudolfingers§! were the only one to finally mix luck and skill just right. As §YEmperor Bernard’s§! sons geared up to fight a civil war over their fathers titles upon his death in §Y924§!, the §YOttonians§!, led by their patriarch §YOtto Liudolfinger§!, ‘the Great,’ made his move. He appealed to the German Dukes, making the case that only he could prevent the brewing Frankish war from spilling out into Germany. The Germans listened, and when they met in Aachen, they named Otto their Emperor. The Carolingians, embroiled still in civil war, could only protest.\n\nAs his first act as Emperor, Otto moved against Francia in its moment of weakness. In the mid 10th Century, Otto pried §YArles§! and §YLotharingia§! away from Paris’s grasp. Otto hoped that this would weaken Francia permanently and end Carolingian domination of the Empire. His grand designs were not to last. By the time Otto died in AD §Y973§!, Francia had already recovered by leaps and bounds, and while the Ottonian line retained the emperorship until the death of §YOtto III§!, their dynasty had already begun to decline. When the Dukes reconvened in AD §Y1014§!, the Styrians, Fraconians, and Swabians were pressured into backing the Franks, rather than Otto III’s designated heir, §YHeinrich II of Saxony§!. The new Emperor, upon learning that Heinrich and the dissident dukes protested the election, invaded Saxony soon after. The §YHarrying of the North§! was a horrible affair. The Ludolfingers were exterminated, Saxony was looted of all its worth, and her allies scattered to the wind. In place of the freshly annihilated enemy, the Franks rose the outwardly loyal §YBillungs§! to the Dukedom.\n\nHowever, the Billungs were simply better players of the Great Game than the Liudolfingers. They knew Francia would recover. They also knew that the Franks would seek vengeance on Saxony for its usurpation. By paying lip service to the Carolingians, they secured their existence as everything around them burnt. They moved quickly to pacify the chaos that had overtaken their lands, waging war against the bandits who roamed the countryside, erstwhile the rebellious counts in the West were subject to Billung suzerainty after a crushing defeat on the Elbe. With extensive reconstruction underway, Saxony was soon tamed. However, the brilliance of Otto’s reign, and the Liudolfingers’ humiliating fall, had never truly been forgotten to the Saxons. And so, for centuries, as the §YBrüderkriege§! consumed the world around them, Saxony slowly built itself up once more.\n\nIt is now AD 1444, and the regnant Duke §YHeinrich V von Billung§! is in a better position than anybody since Otto himself to achieve Saxony’s dream.

While the Franks dominated the Empire during Charlegmane’s reign and after, the Swabians kept their heads down. They were ambitious but not stupid. So they waited as Karl the Great died and his successors fell shorter and shorter of his reputation. They slowly but steadily amassed incredible amounts of influence over Germany, particularly Southern Germany. When the Saxons under the ambitious Otto the Great plotted to seize the throne as Emperor Bernard died, the Swabians were the first of many future allies Otto approached. With promises of incredible wealth and influence packing their heads, when the Princes gathered in 924 after Bernard’s death Swabia was the first and loudest to cheer for their new Emperor.\n\nThe Iron Century was a golden age for Swabia. The Swabians swiftly established dominion over Southern Germany. However, with their dominion assured, the Hohenstaufens fell into decadence. To the Swabians there was little else to do. All of South Germany and its seemingly abundant wealth was at their beck and call. Then, as all things do, the Iron Century came to an end. The Ottonian line lost the crown in 1014 after the death of Otto III. When the Swabians met to back their claimant they found the Franks, angry and hungry for vengeance. In return for not being subject to reprisals, the Swabians suddenly switched sides. They threw their might behind the Frankish candidate, along with the South German electors and the Saxons were dethroned. The Swabians then sat back and watched in stoic horror as Paris’s vengeance tore through Saxony. They watched as the Empire was once more forced to toe the line and Otto’s dream of a united Germany burned in the fires of a thousand conflicts that followed Saxony’s destruction.\n\nBound by Francian threats, they were even forced to watch as the Styrians swiftly rose to prominence in their own backyard. The young and energetic Styrians seemed like a sure successor to the long past their prime Hohenstaufens. However, their new Duke, Fredriech Barbarossa was determined to fight back against the seemingly inevitable. Using an assault on their Tyrolean allies as a casus belli Barbarossa executed a masterful campaign in 1150. The Sytrians were crushed, their subjects in Bavaria liberated and Swabian dominance once more enforced.\n\nHowever, the new golden age was brutally short. The Third Crusade in the late 1180s saw Barbarossa head off the Holy Land and make himself a legend, never to return. With their Duke gone his son Conrad II took over but was left powerless to stop his fathers web of alliance and suzerainty from dissolving. However, so masterful was Barbarossa’s victory that even now that he was gone nobody was brave enough to challenge ultimate Swabian rule. Since then Swabia has persisted in this diplomatic limbo existing as hegemon solely on the reputation of a man who is now long dead. Despite this Europe is poised for an era of change. Swabia, long having settled into its position, may now find itself forced into a new future, pushed forwards by the winds of change."

With him came an entourage of English missionaries, with whom Edgar had entrusted the rapid §YChristianisation§! of the Swedes and Geats. Already a man of the cross himself, Karl would, through his endorsement of proselytisation, earn the epithet of §Y'The Pious'§!. Throughout his reign, Karl warmly welcomed Christians fleeing from persecution in Denmark and Norway, yet while the Old Gods remained strong in some parts, they withered and died across much of Sweden at marching pace. Alas, the end of Karl's reign as the first king of a unified Sweden would be far less illustrious than its beginning.\n\nWhen Norway plunged into a succession war in the 1130s, the ageing Karl saw a chance to wage holy war against his wayward kinsmen, commencing the first phase of the §YGreat Northern Crusade§!, but his death merely a year into the campaign ensured that it fell flat, sputtering out with minimal gains. The border territories of Norway regularly lapsed between occupation zones and pretender strongholds, and it took until the defeat of §YKarl the Hostage§!, grandson of Karl the Pious, in 1181 for Sweden to find itself at peace once again. Repeated attempts at continuing the Crusade would persist for enough generations to warrant their own sagas, and the Crusade's drain on Swedish manpower necessitated the creation of a chivalric brotherhood akin to the §YTeutonic Order§!.\n\nKnown as the §YCarolean Order§!, they are among the boldest and deadly warriors in Northern Europe, having earnt their fame and prestige with the conquest and conversion of Norrland in the 1220s. Unfortunately, with the splendour of their victories against the §YSami§! and §YFinns§! waning, and centuries of failing to oust the Danish and Norwegian heathens waxing, the Caroleans are increasingly seen as lions led by sheep. Leadership in both the Order and the Army is bought and sold at the whimsy of nobles, most of whom have never even swung a great-axe. In response to this, veteran soldiers and the privy council seek to take action against the growing corruption. Then again, perhaps a brutal defeat on the field is what the Swedes require to get their footing once more.\n\nWith the §YHoly Roman Empire§! beginning to enter what may very well be its death throes, and the normally isolationist pagan kings setting their sights on greater borders for their crowns, the people and church of Sweden have been calling for a renewal of the Great Northern Crusade. As the old order crumbles away ever so slowly, the revitalisation of Sweden proves to be the most critical of matters rapidly piling up on the King’s lap. Should he succeed, the Kingdom of Sweden will surely shine like the Northern Lights; a beacon of Christendom in the otherwise frigid boreal wastes of Europa. However, if Sweden fails to sufficiently prepare, the Kingdom will likely fall to assailants on all sides, the Cross shattered under the feet of a great heathen army."

It took till 965 that all of Sicily was conquered. The following century saw the arrival of the Normans. These men came from the far north and were originally mercenaries for hire. They first served the Byzantines who tried to reconquer the island of Sicily but defected after a failed campaign. They managed to seize some lands in mainland southern Italy after dealing with the local garrisons. \n \nMeanwhile the Emirate of Sicily fractured in opposing factions. One of these factions asked the Normans for help, they obliged seeing they could destabilize Sicily even further and perhaps seize a fortress along the coast. Hearing of this, the other factions sent a delegation to the Governor of Tunis. The delegation was able to convince the him to send an army lead by his sons. The two armies clashed at the village of Cerami. The Normans had less men but a superior army. They fought bravely but in the end had to retreat. The Mankit faction seized control and ruled Sicily from that point.\n \nIn 1328 Abu Zakirya took the throne in Tunis and founded the Hafsid dynasty. After securing his power, he sent one of his sons to Sicily as a diplomat and advisor. His son Abu Zakariya Yahya, was able to climb the ranks and in 1340 overthrow the current ruler. He consolidated his rule, made a standing army and improved the economy through reforming taxes and increasing trade with the Muslim world. When his father died in 1349, he sailed to Tunis with his army to claim the throne. After a short skirmish he was crowned Emir of Tunis and Sicily. But his ambitions wouldn’t stop there.\n \nThree years later he crossed the straits and marched to Naples. The Normans formed a coalition including the Papal States, Genoa and Florence, while Lombardy sent some mercenaries fearing for their own safety. While the coalition outnumbered him, Yahya had learned from the Normans and invested in quality. The two armies met near Amalfi. The coalition army was decimated after the leaders of the army couldn’t agree on tactics. Yahya sieged Naples and was able to take it without resistance. This increased his power but he died 2 years later.\n \nHe decided to split the Sultanate between his two sons. The Sunni son would gain Tunis while the Shiite one would gain Sicily.

Initially based in Jerusalem, the Order’s successful mission to establish hospitals and care for the Faithful suffering from ailments would ultimately see the Crusader States’ sovereigns make substantial donations to expand the mission. Alongside the Knights Templar, the Hospitallers would expand to serve as armed guards for Pilgrims travelling to the Holy Land, though they never lost their reputation for going above and beyond to act with charitas and pietas to all under their care. Unfortunately, the overbearing Ayyubid Sultanate under renowned Kurdish warrior-statesman Saladin would necessitate further militarisation in an effort to save the Christian Kingdoms. Droves of Latin brethren joining the ranks of the Templars and Hospitallers ensured an astronomical growth in strength amongst the Crusader Kingdoms throughout the 13th Century, as well as a continuation of Baldwin IV’s grand strategy for Jerusalem against the Saracens.\n \nReaching their absolute peak of power in the early 14th Century, at the same time as the nascent Nizzarid Sultanate’s expansion into former Ayyubid and Abbasid-controlled lands met its conclusion, it only made sense for the Holy Orders to be outfitted for a protracted campaign. Alas, the Holy Land slipped into a period of uncertainty and economic dependency on Venice in the 1340s, erstwhile the Black Death turned the hospitals into temporary morgues. Fearing the worst was yet to come, the Hospitaller Grandmaster - with the Papacy’s oversight - made the Doge of Venice an offer he couldn’t refuse. In exchange for economic monopoly over the Order’s profits, not to mention much of their rather expansive treasury, they would receive the island of Rhodes, off the coast of Anatolia, which would henceforth become the Hospitallers’ primary headquarters.\n \nIn the preceding decades, multiple long-standing conflicts against rival naval powers stretched the Venetians too thin to garrison their non-Adriatic holdings effectively. Thus upon seeing an easy solution to their woes while also being able to save face, Venice accepted the proposal and transferred the rebellious territory to the Hospitallers, fully expecting them to be cast out to sea by the locals. Perhaps in the cruellest twist of fate for Venice since their fleet was burnt at anchor by Greek Fire in the 1200s, the Order suppressed dissent early on and had even driven up recruitment of Rhodians into the organisation. Entrenched on Rhodes for almost one hundred years come the mid-15th Century, the Hospitallers stand poised in as good a position as any to aid Christendom however they see fit.

Despite a seemingly common cause, these rump states could not be any more different in their origins. Asturias and Galicia claim descent from the Germanic Suebi and Visigoths, who had invaded during the Roman Empire’s decline. Navarra, meanwhile, traces its people’s lineage to the ancient Vascone and Aquitanian tribes, having re-emerged following Islam’s destruction of the prior Visigothic hegemony.\n \nUpon the heathens’ initial thrust into Visigothic lands, many who had attempted to muster resistance were merely swatted aside. However, one noble by the name of Pelagius was eventually able to stage a rebellion against the newly-arrived oppressors. From the courage of himself and his allies, the Kingdom of Asturias was forged. Upon the death of Pelagius’ successor Favilla, the Crown of Asturias subsequently passed to Adelfuns, Duke of Cantabria. Adelfuns, much like Pelagius, was a man of notable success when it came to warfare. Before his own death, he had carved out a realm comprising both Galicia and Asturias, but long after Adelfun’s passing dynastic squabbles would permanently separate the two realms.\n \nNavarre’s successful bid for independence, unlike that of the Visigothic struggle, was much more of a miracle. The Basque were often finding themselves at their enemies’ swordpoints, from the Romans to the Cordobans, though Inigo Arista, Lord of Pamplona, would put a stop to that. In the 9th Century AD he successfully threw out a Carolingian invasion force before also raising the flag of rebellion against his Muslim overlords. Despite expiring briefly after this, Inigo’s actions successfully consolidated power for the Jimenez Dynasty and would result in the Kingdom of Navarre’s rise.\n \nUpon the start of the Crusades many Iberian noblemen sent their sons to the Holy Land to wage war against the Saracens in their heartland, and upon their return countless Holy Orders would be established as an honourable avenue for second children to pursue. With their proliferation came a greater bond with the Catholic church; a bond which had permitted enough strings to be pulled for the commencement of an Iberian Crusade.\n \nThis fateful expedition would not be Iberia’s saving grace, sadly. Instead, in AD 1443, the Frankish-led force would be dealt a bloody yet hard-fought defeat at the hands of the Caliph. Countless nobles from all across the Holy Roman Empire and in Iberia itself fell outside the gates of Valencia, erstwhile the lands in the north were burnt to ashes by Christian raiding parties intending to starve out the Muslim forces in pursuit. The combined threat of famine and a renewed offensive were only staved off by a hasty peace agreement between the Franks and Umayyads, yet this would ill suffice in the eyes of the Iberian crusaders. Feeling betrayed and with their faith dashed in a single campaign, the future remains uncertain."

Afterwards they would come under the influence of the Franks, whose Empire first drew them in as a tributary state, and then a vassal of Francia.\n\nContrary to such arrangements, Brittany’s Duke’s have their own notions on the role of Brittany in Western Europe; often in opposition to its neighbours.

The grateful Ottonians did just that, gladly separating Brittany from the Kingdom of West Francia as it had with many other Frankish duchies.\n\nThe second treason saw Conan II expand the Breton demesne. Before William the Bastard’s failed invasion of England, the Norman claimant had warned neighbouring Princes against invading in his absence; William's mission bore the papal banner and was sanctified by Rome. Conan nevertheless informed William he was in fact going to take the opportunity to invade Normandy, claiming Avranchin and Cotentin as historical parts of the Duchy of Brittany, and thus his rightful lands.\n\nA force of knights marched east, pushing past the Breton March of Pouance and onto Rouen. Whilst on the warpath Conan’s squire would conspicuously perish around one of Conan’s suits of armor. Poisoned by a pair of gloves intended for Conan, this was likely an assassination attempt by William. Cautiously, albeit more determined, the Breton duke laid siege to the capital of Normandy, forcing the newly-crowned Robert of Normandy to surrender more than half of his territory.\n\nThis triumph would create a golden age for the Duchy; the wealth and power secured by victory propelling them to heights unseen. During this period many great castles and cathedrals were constructed, and piles of money were made trading with a grateful England, its incidental ally. Under the reign of Conan II, the Breton court was patron to many great men, including bards who sang folk tales in the Breton tongue. The Celtic language gained prestige in its association with the victorious Bretons, and slowed the encroachment of Frankish linguistic dominance in Brittany.\n\nCoinciding with the end of Conan’s 50-year reign was a Frankish plot to subdue England, predicated on reviving the Norman claims to the English throne. To that end, Francia coerced the Bretons to cede their Norman lands or risk war. Never the type to submit completely, the Breton’s became inspired by a centuries-old set of Ottonian Privileges.  Granted to them by Otto I himself, and known as the Privligium Britancullum, this theoretically grants them much of France. It is up to the cunning duke to decide how this document is put to use..."

When the Frankish empire was at its height, an uncontested juggernaut in Europe, these lands formed a rich and fertile core that helped uphold the power and wealth of the Franks. Yet such a massive empire could be undone by one impotent ruler, or the deep machinations of its web of politics. Such was the case when Emperor Bernard I, the bastard son of Charles the Fat, died in 924. His sons tore his realm asunder, and the Carolingian banner burned in the flames of war. The very next year, Otto Liudolfinger of the Saxons was chosen as the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nThe German Emperor marched against the remnants, shattering the Carolingians. The Nibelungs, a cadet branch of the Carolingians, were crowned in Lotharingia by Otto. Their incompetent rule, however, led to rising discontent within the Low Countries. It was the Frisians who broke off first in 988, with harsh demands from feudal lords resulting in a large-scale peasant rebellion. This cascaded further, as both Dutch and Frisian peasants refused to be forced into levy against their neighbours for their overlords in Lorraine, nor pay any more extravagant taxes. Twelve years later, in the passing of the millennium, nearly all of the Low Countries had broken free from Lotharingia, the Nibelungs too busy with internal strife and discordant politics to react.\n\nWhat resulted was a patchwork of counts and dukes, with only the Frisians rejecting the power of feudalism. This freedom was hard fought, however, as on two separate occasions, in 1011 and again in 1035, two Dukes of Holland attempted - and failed - to subjugate the Frisians, ending in the deaths of both. Aside from their own conflicts, the Low Countries were spared from the bloody trail the Carolingians carved when they made their resurgence a mere century after Otto's ascendance, burning Saxony to the ground from 1014-1024.\n\nWhile the Empire clashed with the Slavic pagans, the Dutch developed their maritime and commercial affairs and traded their luxury goods. While the Albigensian Crusade ravaged southern Francia, the Frisians, whose independence was recognized by the Carolingians, merely tended to their own business, unbothered by war. When the Hussites of Bohemia clashed with the Empire and the Papacy, the Flemish sent naught a man to any cause, instead developing their own industries of cloth and glasswork, establishing cities more urbanised than any other Europe had seen since the fall of Rome.\n\nBut can such peace last forever? The English port of Calen threatens trade in the Channel, and the Lotharingians, long since having replaced the foolish Nibelung with the clever and rich Hohenstaufens, are preparing to sink their fangs into the Frankish corpse pulled along by its decrepit Emperor. Who is to say they won't turn and reclaim their lands once again? Echoes of ambitious rulers ring out in their chambers and courts. Were the Low Countries united into one, their wealth and splendour would become the envy of the world...\n\n"

 string_start_capua:0 "Amidst the chaos of the 9th and 10th Centuries, an innumerable heathen host wrestled the island of Sicily from Byzantine hands, forcing the Greeks to withdraw their remaining forces to Italy-proper. Indeed, the situation proved dire enough to necessitate recruitment of mercenaries from across Europe. Chief among the brave few who took up the sword for Christendom were the Normans, hailing from Francia and the far north, and renowned as cunning yet cruel opportunists.\n\nAlas, despite Byzantium’s best efforts to reclaim the lost island, the incessant infighting of the local landholders saw their power base in Southern Italy disintegrate by the 11th Century, thus spurring the Normans into action. Baring their fangs for friend and foe alike to see, the once-loyal mercenaries turned their spears and cavalry against the Greeks. In AD 1050, the daring adventurer Robert ‘Guiscard’ de Hauteville had finally purged the last bastions of Byzantine resistance in Apulia, declaring himself King of Trinacria with Imperial and Papal assent, despite never holding titular lands beyond Messina. While initially a strong bulwark against both the Greeks and Sicilians, it was only a matter of time before a gale blew the straw house away.\n\nBrought on by intense dynastic and feudal conflicts, a period of decline in the following centuries culminated in the Sicilian invasion of Naples in 1352, swatting all but the Normans away with relative ease. Though the Latin Coalition was formed in the 1340s to stave off the Saracen hydra, the Normans were abandoned following an aristocratic spat on the eve of the fateful Battle of Amalfi in AD 1353. With most of the remaining Italian forces decisively destroyed, and the fall of Naples that same year, the Normans withdrew to the stronghold of Capua along with the royal treasury, and what storm-battered hulks remained of the once proud Trinacrian fleet.\n\nCome AD 1355 the situation was deemed irreversible, but a wrench was thrown in the works when the Normans achieved a miraculous victory at the Battle of Capua in the Summer of that year, routing the Sicilian besiegers in a daring night attack. When the Emir of Sicily succumbed to camp fever three days later, the already demoralised Saracens were hurled into disarray. The beleaguered Normans seized calls for peace by the throat; in exchange for respite and the release of valuable hostages, King Hubert of Trinacria controversially surrendered his crown for recognition as Duke in Capua.\n\nEffectively forced into servitude by the Pope, the Normans have been biding their time for nigh on a century. In the early 15th Century, the ambitious Duke Rufus III and his eccentric son Robert had reformed the rump state into a reaver’s haven. Alas, with Rufus’ death at Valencia in 1443, Robert XI de Hauteville finds himself standing alone, derided as the Mad Duke of Capua for his increasingly eccentric and unstable mental state. The cornered wolf that he is, though, Robert - in spite of all his shortcomings - won’t hesitate to strike, the moment he finds an opening."

While many of the people of the steppe were integrated into the new Mongol Empire, remnants of the Tangut court fled, establishing the Li dynasty along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, around the settlement of Jianqiang. While the Yuan expanded their control to the southern Song, the Li expanded outward into the surrounding territory, stretching their fledgling state to the banks of the Yarlung River, and further into Tibet. \n \nWhile the court remains predominately Tangut, the subjects they ruled over varied from native Han and Tibetan and created internal strife. Sinicization was a practice often adopted and implemented, echoing the work of former Xia emperors, which created a backlash. In 1254, the state submitted to the Yuan dynasty, accepting their role as a vassal to the new Emperor Kublai Khan, in order to avoid extermination once again. Under his rule, the country was even more influenced by Confucian and Mongol culture, and the Tangut Court faced an identity crisis. In 1275, court infighting over the role of Confucianism and Buddhism led to the Li Xiao, the at the time emperor, to be assassinated and removed by his nephew, Li Bo. Li Bo implemented a series of traditionalist reforms, harkening back to their Traditional Buddhist roots, and, in the end, leaning more towards the mountains of Tibet than the plains of China. \n \nDuring the Red Turban Rebellion, the Li saw their chance and took it, leaving the Yuan to their fate and seeking to expand their own territory.

For the next few decades, the tribes of Oirat remained isolated and divided until opportunity arose.  During the §YToluid Civil War§! of 1260, the four tribes of Choros, Torghut, Dorbet, and Khoid united under one banner, tossing their support to Ariq Boke against the great Kublai Khan. They entered the conflict with hopes of taking vast amounts of riches and gaining enormous prestige from the conflict, so much so that the Oirat would once more be a major player in Steppe politics.\n \nHowever, their dreams were quickly dashed. The war ended with §YKublai§! standing the victor, and the Four Oirat were dissolved by the end of it. Since that time, the Oirat remained isolated and divided, with petty squabbles breaking out among the remaining tribes over various reasons. During this period, due to §YKhitan§! influence from the west, the Choros converted to the Nestorian Faith, while the rest of the tribes saw a massive influx of Tibetan Buddhist monks, causing conflict with the local shamans. Furthermore, with the collapse of the §YChaghatai§!

This political turmoil further dampened any dreams of unification; but all was not lost for the Oirat.

This re-established statehood was a spark of hope and a chance for a new beginning. Unfortunately, their ambition to restore the former §YLiao Empire§! was soon shattered by the invading §YMongols§!, who defeated the Khitans and made their lands a part of their new Empire. As mighty as it was, the Empire of Genghis soon crumbled under its own weight, placing Khitans under the suzerainty of one of the it’s successor states – the §YChagatai§! Horde. However, in more ways than one their defeat and subjugation was a blessing. In an attempt to homogenise his domain, Chagatai ultimately favored a Khitan court culture with Mongol oversight. This had the unintended effect of making the Khitans very influential. something that future Chagatai khans would realise too late. Successive rulers slowly become Khans in name only, subject to the whims of their Khitan courtiers.\n\nHowever, this status quo was not to last, as the Pax Mongolica allowed for renewed flourishing of §YChristianity§!. Though Buddhism was still the nominal religions of the Mongols, amongst the Khagan’s most populous subjects the Christian faith was growing rapidly. Seeing this as a threat to his rule, §YTarmashirin Khan§! sought to crush the presence of §YNestorianism§! within his domains. Because the Khitans were the most affected by this bloody purge, their influential kinsmen in court began organising a rebellion against Chagatai rule. Tarmashirin made many attempts to pacify the region over the next decade, but with the §YTocharians§! also joining in the revolt, his realm violently burst apart at the seams. Ultimately, the former Khan fled to the §YGolden Horde's§! court, having been humiliated in battle and faced with mass desertion. Despite initially possessing the means to do so, plans to reinstate Tarmarishin's heirs never came to fruition, due to the Red Turban Rebellion's onset in the 1350s. Thus, the Mongol Empire acknowledged Qara Khitai, under the prestigious §YYelü§!, as the Chagatai Khanate's successor-state.\n\nWith this new era of internal peace, §YTianzuo§!

The Yuan Emperor Jingzhong, who had marital ties with King U of Goryeo, had arrived to seek shelter after his uncle Khutala seized the throne of Yuan in 1381. Five years would pass before Goryeo struck at the self-styled Dezu Emperor’s territories, hoping to reinstall Jingzhong to his throne by 1386. Unfortunately, expectations were unable to meet reality, as the war would grind on for three years, with no clear end in sight by 1389.\n\nPublic outrage at the King, for maintaining the nation in vassalage under an ailing empire, inspired one man to take a stand.

The last fifty years have seen both kingdoms bide their time, occasionally lashing out, probing each other’s defences, but never fully committing. This will all change soon enough, though, for Yuan’s hegemony is waning, and its death spiral heralds war. Soon, conflict shall engulf the Far East, and Korea must be united if it is ever to survive.

Although the rebellion failed to dislodge Kublai’s line, it nonetheless preserved Nestorianism within China, and secured greater power for the Mongol and Jurchen clans.\n\nThe tensions within Yuan, amplified by Nayan, further worsened due to an innumerable number of succession crises, topped off by the endemic Black Death, and severe famines.

With a sizeable influx of fresh troops disembarking, the invaders were able to make headway into Kyushu, having overwhelmed local resistance.\n\nIn the perfect position to maintain a brief offensive against the Shogunate, the Mongols would divide their armies into two groups; one force would overrun Shikoku, subduing the island, whilst another would march through Western Honshu. While the Shikoku Group managed to accomplish their objectives with few complications, the Honshu army was not so lucky. Facing constant harassment and severe attrition the whole time, they were forced to make a desperate rush for Kyoto, seizing the capital and the young §YEmperor Go-Uda§! before a relief force could arrive.\n\nWith the emperor as a hostage and unwilling to further stretch supply lines, the Yuan had the Shogun dragged before the negotiating table to make a number of concessions.

While subordinate to the emperor in Beijing, the Sakya government was given some autonomy and control over the eastern Kham regions, with regional administrations in Lingtsang and Gonjo serving directly under the Sakya. The Xuanzheng Yuan, or the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, was created during this time. Run by Tibetan Buddhists, it was the dominating organization by which not only the Sakya answered to, but also the various monasteries and missions that the other sects of Buddhism followed. However, all was not as it seemed. While many would assume that Tibet was a unified entity, it was rife with internal and regional strife. In the mid-14th Century, with the receding Yuan, the Sakya faced rebellion from the growing power of the Phagmodrupa dynasty.\n\nThe Phagmodrupa dynasty, led by the charismatic Changchub Gyaltsen, launched several revolts against the Sakya, hoping to control the various myiarchies within Tibet. The ruler of the Sakya at the time, the young and unassuming Lotro Gyaltsen, was called upon to support his territory against the new challenger to Sakya rule. With aid from the surviving Yuan, the Phagmodrupa dynasty was halted before they could continue their offensive into the Sakya territory. With this, the regional kingdoms in Kham became independent, with Lingstang and Gonjo becoming the new dominant powers in the region, along with a resurgent Tangut state in Li pushing into the south of Kham. In short, the Sakya dominion had collapsed around all but the territory surrounding their home monastery. In the ensuing years, the Phagmodrupa would collapse from regional infighting, with the new Rinpungdra dynasty breaking free and controlling the northern Tsang territories around Lhasa, leaving the older state in U. While the Sakya state attempted to capitalize on this weakness, the state simply had too few soldiers and support to properly attack into their weakened neighbors; the Mongol Yuan were far too focused on their own rebellions to intervene in Tibet, aside from continuing to support the Mongol controlled Amdo.\n\nThe Year is 1444 and Sakya remains in a three-way deadlock between Tsang and U. Each side must act with the utmost of caution and care; one wrong step and their kingdom could collapse. The current Sakya Trizin remains within the complex walls, content with controlling and defending their own territory over expanding to their rivals. If Sakya wishes to survive the coming century, they must find a way to establish dominance once more over their neighbors and restore their control over Tibet."

 string_start_centraltibet:0 "In the Mid-14th Century, the ruler Changchub Gyaltsen rose up to fight against the dwindling power of the Sakya dynasty. With him, he had the support of his own Phagmodrupa dynasty. The family did not wish to wage war against the Yuan, as even in their weakened state the Yuan’s forces were quite formidable. Instead, a short, concentrated coup within the heart of Tibet allowed them to take control of Lhasa and effectively dethrone the Sakya. However, a Khalkha Force of 10,000 Horsemen came to aid the Sakya at the last minute, breaking away from the Yuan. From here, the Phagmodrupa forces were halted, and could not push further into the heart of the Sakya monastery. From here, the Phagmodrupa established their own kingdom in the heart of Lhasa.\n\nHowever, not all would be well. The Sakya would routinely put pressure on the Phagmodrupa state, battling it out for control of the various families in central Tibet. More so than that, the Li, Ling, and Gonjo all exerted control over the Kham region, creating an uneasy situation politically. This was undercut by internal divisions; regionalism and local families constantly vying for power and dominance within the Kingdom. One such dynasty, the Rinpungdra family, began to gain considerable power at the start of the 15th Century. The two families both primarily backed different sects of Tibetan Buddhism, with Phagmodrupa supporting Gelug schools while Rinpungdra supported the Karmapa sect. In 1430, the Rinpungdra family rallied support and attacked the Phagmodrupa dynasty, taking over Lhasa and the northern Tsang area. This forced the Phagmodrupa into the southern U region, still holding strong.\n\nThe Year is 1444, and the two states of U and Tsang remain in a deadlock with one another. With the ever-present threat of the Sakya dynasty in the west and the Kham dynasties to the east, this position is not the most favorable for either state. However, should they manage to come out on top, one could dominate and control the region completely, reforging the classical Tibetan Empire."

 string_start_kham:0 "When the Mongols established the three major administrative districts in Tibet, the Kham region was perhaps the most disunified. Under the control of various local myiarchies and monasteries, the region lacked much of centralized authority. Instead, power spread outward from monasteries and cities of major importance into the countryside. Here, two monasteries stand out above the rest, that being Lingtsang and Gongjo. Devout followers of the Sakya path, these two city states were key in controlling the region, and their loyalty to the Yuan Empire was oft rewarded. Gongjo would be given governorship over Kham for a time in the 13th century at the behest of Kublai Khan, while the Lingtsang family aided the new Mongol rulers of Amdo. As the Mongol Empire fell back behind the Yellow River, the Sakya’s authority over Tibet began to fade. When the Phagmodrupa rose up against the Sakya, Lingtsang and Gongjo became independent functionally, keeping out of the central Tibetan civil wars.\n\nThis period that followed was one growth, yet also of challenge. The two rival polities expanded their powers outwards, often clashing with one another in spiritually and in the realms of politics. Various monasteries found themselves supporting one side or another, which lead to the rapid growth of the two families. With their placement atop vital silk road trade routes, both the Yuan and the various Chinese states made peace with the Gongjo and Lingtsang, granting them titles and wealth for the ability to traverse through their territory safely. However, rival groups began to rise up to challenge these dueling forces. The Li dynasty, a remnant of the old Tangut Xi Xia state, pushed into the southern Kham territories, expanding their influence over the region. Meanwhile, the Amdo state, run by a descendant of Godan Khan, began to expand their own military prowess into the northern regions as well. The Kham Region is more tense than ever, and with these two rising powers, it is unclear as to whether or not Kham shall be dominated by new or old powers.\n\nThe Year is 1444. The Gyelpos of Gongjo and Lingtsang eye each other’s states with fear and envy. Neither is willing to make the first move, but they paradoxically must move quickly. If they delay, Amdo or Li could move in and dominate them quickly. And if not them, then perhaps should the feuding lords of Central Tibet work together, they could move to re-establish their claims on this territory. Either way, these monasteries must prepare themselves for the coming century, as there will be change, strife, and glory to be had in this new age."

 string_start_amdo:0 "The Amdo region of Northern Tibet is one of shifting empires and powers. With the fall of the Tibetan Empire in the 10th Century, the following period of fragmentation saw the rise of the Tsongkha theocracy, a powerful polity that kept close relations with the Song Dynasty. However, they too would collapse, to the emerging Tangut empire, which became the Western Xia. While this empire stretched across the north of Amdo and the Tsongkha region, it was subsequently destroyed after a brief two century rule, and the Tangut people sent fleeing south in 1236 with the invasion of the Mongol Empire. At this point, the Amdo region was brought under the control of the son of Ogedai, Godan Khan, who established the Amdo state as his own personal realm. He then would lead an army into Tibet, conquering the fractured kingdoms with several thousand Mongol soldiers, and establishing the Sakya rule over the kingdom.\n\nAmdo, during this period, saw a revival of culture and architecture brought on by Mongol patronage. The descendants of Godan were often in a Cho-Yon with the Lamas of the region; the Lamas would bestow titles to the kings, thus giving them legitimacy, while the Kings would provide protection and security to the Lamas. This relationship saw the Mongol empire funding the building of several monasteries across the Amdo region. While the locals were often subject to unfair tax laws that saw much of their wealth leaving to the metropole of Khanbaliq, there was an explosion of art, literature, and buildings unlike anywhere else in Tibet, for a period.\n\nHowever, as the Mongol empire began to recede behind the yellow river, Amdo became increasingly independent from their overlords. The territory of this clan increasingly shrunk to the Amdo region, due to the Yuan administration integrating more and more of the Gansu region. They wished to uphold the Sakya administration in Central Tibet, sending troops to aid the war against U-tsang in the mid-14th Century, but they were not enough. The Mongol dominance over Tibet collapsed shortly after, with Kham, Ngari, and Lhasa slipping out of Mongol hands. The Amdo at this time began to shift their strategy; if the Sakya could not control Tibet, they must be usurped. Thus began their expansion into northern Kham, coming up against fierce resistance from the states of Gongjo and Lingtsang.\n\nThe Year is 1444. Amdo is ruled by the Borjigin Clan, and the descendants of Godan. With the Yuan continuing to struggle for survival, and Tibet being decentralised and broken, the Amdo set their eyes on the territory, hoping to restore their former domain to a new era of Mongol Rule."

However, its position in the Tibetan empire has always been contested. It remained fragmented and broken until the 13th Century, with the power emanating from Ngari slowly being overtaken by that of Purang and Yatse. Foreign invasions from Ladakh and Kara-Khanid maintained this period of darkness, as fewer and fewer monastic temples were built, and no significant power was able to rise in these conditions. However, by 1250, the Kingdom of Guge became united once more under the command of Krhadhicalla. He pushed through and united the provinces of Purang and Yatse as well; however, with his death, the kingdom was absorbed into the Sakya Administration of the Mongols. During this period, Purang and Yatse grew closer once more and re-asserted their dominance over Ngari again, however by the 1370s, the Guge Kingdom pacified Purang and Yatse, dissolving Purang as a polity.\n\nThe following century was something of a golden age for the Guge Kingdom. The fall of the Sakya regime allowed Guge to once more return to prominence as an independent polity. The kingdom became integrated with the Indus River trade, and the wealth received from this venture granted them the ability to rejuvenate the Kingdom. All long the river and the mountains, the lords build large monastical sites with classical Tibetan architecture. While the other states such as Sakya and Kham were locked in combat with one another, the Guge Kingdom continued to grow its wealth and power. Religious reforms of the Gelukpa school in 1420 oversaw a drastic change in the Kingdom’s religious system, leading to it becoming the dominant school in Guge. To say that there were no problems would be untrue; Tocharian raiders from the north continue to plague the kingdom, and the Shule’s conversion to Nestorian have sent waves of missionaries to our kingdom. However, this only infused a new aspect into the state’s cultural golden age, with Murals depicted Nestor and Christ appearing on monastery walls and in new great halls.\n\nThe Year is 1444. Namkha Wangpo, the current ruler of Guge, oversees an age of prosperity and peace within his kingdom. With the current state of Tibet, he looks out at the great plateau with dreams of conquest and glory. Yet, he must remain cautious. Those living in a golden age are often blinded by the brilliance of their works, cannot see its end rapidly approaching.

In a feeble attempt to quell the chaos, Yuan had allowed for local forces to be raised by military leaders, but as more and more authority broke down, these warlords became less reliable. The warlords, and the rebels Yuan hoped they could destroy, would eventually divide China south of the Yellow River into six states: Han, Song, Zhou, Dali, Chu, and Min.\n\nThe warlords just south of the Yellow River were Song, Han, and Zhou. Song was founded by §YZhao Wanpu§!, a son of §YEmperor Gong§! of Song, having conquered feuding warlords of the west after escaping his Tibetan exile. Han, founded by the last remnants of the Red Turbans under §YXu Shouhui§!, has come to dominate much of Central Southern China. Lastly, centred around Jiankang, was the state of Zhou, established by ambitious salt smuggler-turned-warlord §YZhang Shicheng§!.\n\nFurther south lie the states of Dali, Chu, and Min. Dali, a former Yuan ally led by the house of §YDuan§!, has since regained its independence, and with the Yuan in rapid decline, seeks its own path.

Meanwhile, beset by both rebels and traitors, §YChen Youding's§! loyalty to the Yuan would be tested, but his descendants would ultimately turn away from them; the state of Min was subsequently proclaimed.\n\nThese six states would engage in a series of internecine conflicts over the ensuing generations, allying or waging war with each other whenever the time arose.

Assuming command of the Turkic forces, the §YSeljuks§! spearheaded the Mihranid invasion of the Near East. However, the Seljuks were not battling for a foreign king lazing about in the Persian heartland; they had their own dreams of conquest and glory. While the Mihranid dynasty struggled for power amidst a civil war, the Seljuks continued their great campaign in the west. In the aftermath of the §YBattle of Manzikert§!, the Seljuks seized much of Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus, proclaiming their own empire and turning the tables against the Sassanids.\n\nThe Seljuks threw off their Iranian masters and declared a new empire in the west, subjugating the Mihranids and attempting to Turkify the entire region. While the Seljuk Empire was mighty, it was internally divided upon religious, cultural, and tribal lines. Since the Seljuks had no official state religion other than their shamanistic steppe faith, they were pulled in different directions. Some turned to §YOrthodox§! §YChristianity§!, some to the Sunni faith, and others to the traditions of the Persian elite. Even bringing in Turkic tribes to settle the Caucasus did not prevent the fledgling state's fracturing. By the time the §YMongol Empire§! pushed through Iran and Armenia in the 13th Century, the Seljuk state was already on the verge of collapse; and so, it did. Most of their lands were rent asunder and divided amongst numerous beyliks, with the Seljuk rump state of Anatolia relying upon the §YAyyubids§! for support against the mighty §YIlkhanate§!. During this time, §YHashim the Pious§! converted to §YIslam§! at the behest of the Ayyubid Caliph, securing an alliance that would continue even after their fall to the §YNizzarids§!.\n\nFortuitously, the Ilkhanate suffered from its own malaise, rupturing at the seams within mere decades. The hasty demise of their short-lived rivals thus permitted the Seljuks to once again thrust into Anatolia.

These §YBeyliks§!, as they were known to be called, became dominant in expanding the frontiers of the empire and establishing Turkish communities. However, as the Empire grew larger, soon the Beyliks were faced with a difficult proposition. The Seljuks were doomed to collapse, as their state had grown weak and their army was fracturing. As such, when the state came under attack by the §YMongols§!, many lords chose instead to submit to the invaders or break away and form their own states.\n \nThe breakup of the Seljuk empire began in the late 13th Century, and over this time, several major Beyliks began to organize themselves; the §YAnushtenigids§!, the §YArtuqids§!, the §YChepnids§!, the §YZangid State§!, and the §YIsfendiyarids§!. These states were found in the west of Anatolia, as there they faced limited threat from the §YIlkhanate§!. The Anushtenigids and Artuqids were among the first to convert to §YChristianity§!, claiming both sincere conversion and a political desire to create closer ties with the Byzantines. The Zangids were a republic controlled by a single family, and their conversion to Orthodoxy followed shortly after. The Chepnids, however, much like the remnant Seljuk state, converted to Sunni Islam, believing that appeasing the Seljuks and the §YAyyubids§! would prevent their destruction. The Beyliks underneath the Ilkhanate faced challenges to survive in that tumultuous state, with some finding power and others being wiped off the face of the map.\n\nOne such group, the §YSarukhanids§!, decided to play to the remaining Persian nobility, and took up the practices of §YZoroastrianism§!. By the late 14th Century, the Ilkhanate had collapsed and the Seljuks were on the rise yet again.

The Golden Horde frequently quarrelled with their brothers in the §YIlkhanate§! of Persia, contesting rule over Azerbaijan and Georgia countless times.

The major blow to the authority of the Golden Horde came in 1428, with the rebellion of the §Yuzbeks§! under §YAbu'l-Khayr Khan§!, who established an independent §YShaybanid§!-led state east of the Golden Horde.\n\nBy the year 1444 AD, the Golden Horde is in a sorry state. Still subject to minor Khans staging revolts, and only receiving tribute from a handful of subjects, the Empire looks to be finally in its sunset years. §YCrimean§! Princes, having grown increasingly focused on development of their ties with Eastern Europe and the Black Sea, have been whispering of defection for years. Descendants of the notorious Kingmaker §YNogai Khan§! have been calling for secession following repeated failures of recent Khans to re-establish authority over the empire. Meanwhile, the Tatars of the Volga, centered around §YKazan§!, have been noted assembling to talk about the establishment of their own Islamic state, free of the Golden Horde's tiresome machinations.

It would not be such a stretch for him to step into a more central political role among the Wendish people.\n\nTo Veleti’s west, the §YOborite§! tribe has established a state on the fringes of the German Hanseatic League.

Their close ties to the Poles and Baltic §YPruthenians§! set them apart from their western neighbors. Additionally, the location of the Pomeranians’ tribal land lends itself to a more aggressive political strategy, as they are surrounded by Pagans and need not worry about drawing the ire of the German states.\n\nNo matter which tribe rises to the occasion, one thing remains true: the fate of Wendish culture lies in the balance.

This saw the end of the English domination of the country; however, it was not the end to their problems.\n\nKing Owain failed to properly secure the loyalty of all his princes in the following years of his reign.

While there was peace for 200 Years, in the year 1358, the King of Glywysing, Dafydd, supported by the Anglo-Saxons, raised arms against the current King Rodhri Gwynedd, the descendent of Owain the Great, and the current king of Wales. The fighting was fierce and lasted for several decades. However, when Owain Glyndwr led his forces down south, he began to win the war. In the daring encirclement of Abertawe in 1372, Owain managed to trap and capture the king Dafydd. This quickly brought an end to the conflict and awarded Owain both support and riches.

The Condor Dynasty declared this a great victory and a new chapter in their history began. The Cornish dukes subsequently began to rebuild a prosperous state and encourage their own culture to flourish again. Given that the English nobility were the primary landholders in Cornwall before the revolt, there were not many Anglo-Saxon local rulers to displace, giving the Condor Dynasty an easy chance to set up their new regime. However, the primary citizens in Dewnens are still the Anglo-Saxons who migrated there under English rule, for now cowed by their new overlords.\n\nThere was a marked change in Cornish politics with the ascension of one §YDuke Conan§!, who some call mad for his ambitions.

Alas, William the Bastard's unfortunate demise in AD 1066 was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster for Normandy.\n\nThough the young duke's reign held so much untapped potential and ambition, it was cut mercilessly short during the Great Rout of Hastings, when he was trampled to death by his own fleeing soldiers. Now, he and many more of Normandy's finest are buried in a sodden trench on English soil.\n\nWith word of the duke's passing, the barons took no time in tearing each other apart in order to back William's young children as different claimants. Robert Curthose and William Rufus' rival factions would be pitted against one another, and although their lineages persisted for several generations, the feeble sputter that was Robert I's reign would endure the full brunt of English wroth.\n\nHoping to take advantage of civil unrest in England upon the death of Harold II in AD 1098, the Franks attempted to press the claim held by William's heirs. Alas for Normandy, most of the combined fleet it and Francia had built was destroyed in a storm, taking with it William Rufus, brother of Duke Robert. Shortly thereafter, the English would seize Calais, while their Breton allies marched into Normandy, deposing Robert Curthose in the process.\n\nWhen peace was made in AD 1101, Normandy was partitioned between Brittany and England, who had also received Calais as compensation from the Franks. Robert Curthose made no attempt to liberate his homeland, and was exiled to Flanders until his death in AD 1127. Survived by one son, and the lineage of his brother Richard, Robert was the last of his dynasty to hold Normandy.\n\nThrough a complex web of marriages, the Angevin line of Geoffrey the Fair, otherwise known as Plantagenet, inherited the House of Normandy's claims upon the extinction of its male line in the 1180s. Following a lengthy insurgency, Richard d'Anjou, son of the late Geoffrey, entered Rouen unopposed in AD 1204, toppling England's ever-ephemeral grasp over Normandy.\n\nKnown to history as Richard the Lion, he would consolidate Angevin authority around the Duchy of Normandy. By selling the dukedom of Gascony to the House of Rohan, and giving Anjou to his younger brother, these short-term losses helped to isolate any potential succession disputes, which once marred the House of Normandy.\n\nIn subsequent years, the Angevins of Normandy engaged in piracy of the English Channel and Breton Coast, while also defending their Outremer cousins during the Crusades. Until the catastrophic failure of the Andalusian Crusade in AD 1443, the House of Anjou had quietly contented itself with letting the world fall apart around it, but now, with Francia on the verge of collapse and England's king growing old, it may be time to let the old lion roar one last time..."

The successors of Svatoslav pursued a policy of fortification and careful diplomacy, securing the Amber Road and ensuring Pannonia would be drawn into no wars that could threaten its integrity. The Franks were more than happy to fund the expanded March of Pannonia as a bulwark in the east, and Pannonia soon found itself a regional link between the Franks in the West, and the various Slavs both North and South.\n\nHaving only had to fend off a minor incursion by the Croatians in the 11th Century, Pannonia has benefitted from a period of relative prosperity, allowing trade to flourish from the Baltic to the Adriatic, with Pannonia as the bridge. By 1444, Pannonia has not been in any major conflits for centuries, and its status as the sturdy eastern march of the Empire is largely forgotten.

Although the Shahis could govern their majority Buddhist subjects, there were still those among the Huns who rejected Buddhism - particularly the cult of §YZun§! - Hindu dissidents whose doctrine blended steppe traditions and vedic worship. While Barha Tegin was able to keep his state together, it split upon his death, with §YSri Tegin Shahi§! staying loyal to the §YTang§! and Buddhism, while his brother §YRutbil Zabul§! took his own host under the Zunist banner. The next several centuries would see intermittent warfare between the two sides, but little would change.\n\nThe §YVarazid Dynasty of Persia§! would shatter the status quo, conquering  Afghanistan in AD 1178 and subjugating the Zunists and Shahi. The §YHouse of Suren§! would be appointed Satraps over Afghanistan from Bost by the Varazids, and by AD 1207 they had expanded to include Balkh and Ghor in their domains. However, Varazid rule did not last; the §YMongols§! under §YGenghis Khan§! shattered Persia, and by AD 1251 they turned towards Afghanistan, sacking Kabul and Bost, and putting Ghazni to the torch. The Zunists, in the wake of their holy city's immolation, retreated to the fortified citadel of Rob, the only stronghold completely untouched by the Mongol raids. The Surenas would meanwhile lose the Northern half of their domains to the §YIlkhanate§!. Mongol rule in Afghanistan was brief, as the Ilkanid governor of Ghor, §YWisnasp Ghoriyan§!, would revolt and subsequently drive the Ilkhanate out of Afghanistan entirely by AD 1283.\n\nThe downfall of the Mongol Khanates would provide much relief to the shattered lands of Afghanistan, yet within a century tensions would once again rise. Come AD 1444, they are primed to boil over once again. In the South, the §YSurenas§! posture as legitimate claimants to not just Afghanistan but all Persia, yet their lands are divided between Buddhists, Zunists, and Zoroastrians; the glory of their illustrious ancestors lost. The §YShahi§! are still a loose tribal federation, vulnerable to divisions and destabilisation. §YGhor§!, meanwhile, is sandwiched between Nestorians in the North and Zoroastrians in the South and West, although their military prowess has saved them from conquest so far. In the highest passes of the Hindu Kush lies the citadel of §YRob§!, the only nation of the Zunist faith, isolated and diminished. Overlooking both Persia and India, Afghanistan may yet prove to be these empires' graveyard, or be doomed to conquest itself."

 string_start_title_southernduchies:0 "The Southern Duchies"
 string_start_southernduchies:0 "The Southern Duchies of Francia are a historical mistake according to Paris, the result of weak Emperors and bad luck. Ask the Dukes however and their grievances are very, very real. The Southern Duchies were first formed during the §YOttonian§! period when their dissident Counts aligned with the Saxon Emperor against Paris, and were afforded status comparable to that of a Duke. This began a long rivalry between the Southern Duchies and the Emperor. This rivalry extended to the religious realm as well as political when new religious ideas came in from the Balkans. §YCatharism§!, a neo-Gnostic and dualist denomination, had begun to spread in the area from Balkan merchants around the 12th century. Starting in §YToulouse§! it crept North, gaining many converts including some lower level government officials. The Count of Nevers even issued an edict in 1396 banning discrimination against the Cathars.\n\nIn §Y1200§!, the Pope began to attempt to deal with the spreading heresy in Francia, either at the behest of the Emperor (according to the Dukes) or of his own volition (according to the Emperor). Initial attempts to reintegrate them quickly went nowhere however as the Cathars refused to accept Papal demands and the Pope also refused to budge from his religious positions. Where the Pope failed however, the aging but zealous §YEmperor Arnulf  IV§! sought to succeed. He demanded the Dukes reign in the Cathars and begin efforts to forcefully reintegrate them into the Church. The Dukes however kept making excuses as to why they couldn't until, in the early years of the 13th Century, Arnulf decided to deal with the Cathars himself, focusing on the 'bleeding heart of heresy', Toulouse itself. The resulting §YAlbigensian Crusade§! was a ferocious affair, vast sections of the Duchy of Toulouse were nearly entirely devastated. Toulouse itself was sacked in 1217 and by then the Cathars were mostly dead, converted or fled. The Emperor Arnulf IV returned to Paris to a grand celebration, leaving behind a devastated countryside an enraged Duke.\n\nThis began a series of rebellions against Paris by the Southern Dukes, usually led by the Duke of Toulouse. Some would be more successful than the others but in the end The Emperor would always prevail. However he could never fully pacify the region. When §YEmperor Robert IV§! invaded Andalusia he took many Southern soldiers as a way to ensure they didn't rise up while he was gone. When Robert and his army was destroyed, the Dukes, again under the Duke of Toulouse rose against Paris. This time they even sent a force West to seize Gascony for a cadet line of the Toulousian family. §YLothair III§!, fighting against rebellious nobles, ambitious imperial electors wanting to seize the moment and an equally rebellious peasantry, had no will or means to fight them. To avoid a war he almost certainly couldn’t win Lothair III and the Southern Dukes came to an agreement. It gave Toulouse and their allies Dukedoms ‘for their generations of service’ and significant autonomy codified in Francian law. Lothair hoped that this would’ve finally placated the rebellious South. He was very wrong. Toulouse now has a new dream, a dream of a Francia liberated from Carolingian tyranny. The lesser Dukes of Nevers and Bourbonniaes, old allies of Toulouse, come from the §YCapet§! family and are related to the Carolingians. Some whisper that Duke Raymond intends to press their claim to replace the widely hated Lothair. In any case, the present Duke of Toulouse Raymond III knows that to leave the Carolingians alone would only delay the extinction of his realm. He must depose the hated Carolingians, place the more…agreeable Capets on the throne and secure his peoples future, free from the oppression of Paris!"
 string_start_title_gascony:0 "The Duchy of Gascony"
 string_start_gascony:0 "Gascony, otherwise known as the §YSouthern March§!, has been on the front lines of Christendom for generations. Established as a march by the Emperor after the §YAndalusians§! reached the Pyrenees it was originally ruled by the §YAngevins in Normandy§!. It was initially given its autonomy during the §YOttonian§! period, a situation the Gascons agreed to so they may focus on their sole reason of existence, the defense of Europe against the Andalusian threat. Eventually it was sold to the Breton §YRohan§! dynasty by §YRichard the Lion§! of Normandy to pay off debts. As time went on the Gascon people grew into a martial culture and, since the Emperor largely left them to their own affairs, they grew to treasure their autonomy, such as it was. When §YEmperor Louis II§! tried to assert more direct authority over the March in 1358 the Gascons rebelled and seized much of Southern France before a crushing defeat at Bordeaux and the death of the §YMad Duke Pascal§! brought the war to an end. Brought back into line but at a higher cost than expected, the Emperor was forced to accept a deal retaining Gascon autonomy in return for Gascony staying largely out of internal Frankish affairs, a good enough deal for both sides.\n\nWhen §YEmperor Robert§! crossed the Pyrenees in the §YAndalusian Crusade§!, the Gascons, for once, eagerly supported their Emperor and his ambitions. Gascon soldiers marched South, doing what they had been training to do for generations. Then, disaster struck as the entire Army was nearly annihilated at §YValencia§!. The Duke barely managed to escape the disaster and led his ragged band of survivors in a fighting retreat all the way back to Gascony. When he returned, he was greeted with news that §YFredelo Toulouse§!, the last of the Gascon Toulouse family line, had seized the Dukedom in his absence. The short §YWar of Two Dukes§! was an almost clean affair. The grizzled veterans of Valencia, sticking with their general, were led into disaster after disaster as the tired and beaten Army attempted to seize Bordeaux, engaging in a series of minor skirmishes on the way. The war ended after just a month and a half when the Rohan Duke was finally captured during a surprise attack on his camp outside Arcachon and sent back to Brest in chains, having been forced to officially renounce his claim on the Duchy in exchange for his life. Now, in 1444 Gascony sits at the crossroads of sorts. Do they expand North, fight with their cousins in the East against the rule of Paris, or move South against their ancestral foe? The decision must be made soon, before this beacon of freedom in the South is snuffed out forevermore."

 string_start_southgermany:0 "To an outsider, §YSouth Germany§! is close to Eden on Earth. Its Kingdoms, Dukes and Counts are rich beyond measure, its lands dotted with Free Cities which have made hoards of money on lucrative trade routes through the Alps and over the past centuries the land has remained untouched by war. However, to those living in the region, it's a place where one can’t rest easily lest they lose everything in an instant. Since the collapse of §YEastern Francia§!, the land has been dominated by a host of Great Houses, chief amongst them the §YHohenstaufens of Swabia§!. They were a key ally to §YOtto the Great§! when he was elected Emperor in the §Y930s§! and were rewarded handsomely for their loyalty. However, when §YFrancia§! retook the throne and launched the §YScouring of Saxony§! in the early §Y1000s§!, Swabia sat back and watched. At the same time in South East Germany the §YBabenburgs of Styria§! rose to challenge the Swabian hegemony. Seizing the throne of §YBavaria§! and having all but united the Austrian Duchy under them, the stage was set for a cataclysmic showdown.\n\nThat showdown came in §Y1150§! when the Styrians attacked the upstart duchy of §YTyrol§! under the minor house of §Yvon Habsburg§!. §YFriedrich Barbarossa§!, Duke of Swabia, invaded the region in defense of his ally. As Barbarossa closed in Babenburg power quickly unraveled. The Bavarian dukes rose in revolt, soon followed by much of Styria itself. To save his throne and his own head, the Styrian duke surrendered, giving up everything but Styria itself. However Barbarossa soon after ran off to the Holy Land in the §YThird Crusade§! and never returned. Ever since Swabia, unofficial hegemon of South Germany, has lived off of his reputation. However words and beliefs rust quicker than steel. As great change threatens to sweep Europe the §YHohenstaufens§! are threatened by new rising players. The opulent §YWittelsbachs§! of Bavaria, resurgent Habsburgs of Tirol and the ancient §YSalians§! of Franconia gather their own power bases and have grand dreams of their own. The stage is set for another titanic clash as powers old and new cross swords for the fate of the region once more. Whoever comes out victorious will be given the heartland of Europe and near limitless futures to choose from. All that remains is for someone, anyone, to make the first move."
 string_start_title_northgermany:0 "Northern Germany"
 string_start_northgermany:0 "The lands of §YNorthern Germany§! have a history few would envy. It was first tamed by §YCharlegmane§! and his fiery invasion of §YSaxony§! in the late 700s and early 800s. However, as the spread of §YChristendom§! to the east slowed, and then nearly fully stopped in the §Y1100s§!, it left parts of North East Germany still in the hands of §YSlavic§! heathen tribes. The Christian kingdoms on their borders continue to petition the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope for assistance fighting the near constant raids from these hellish pagans. However, events elsewhere in North Germany drowned out their pleas. Discord and chaos in Francia left the Imperial throne open to ambitious men and §YDuke Otto of Saxony§! seized his chance, being elected §YHoly Roman Emperor§! in the §Y930s§!, instead of one of the slate of Frankish claimants.\n\nThe reign of the §YOttonians§!, the §YIron Century§! as the Franks have come to call it, led to almost all of North Germany falling under Saxon rule or influence, or that of their close allies. For some the rule of the Ottonians was a time of unbridled prosperity and wealth. For others, an era of savage oppression and despotism. It wasn’t until the end of the Iron Century early §Y1000s§! that the Franks retook the throne and the Ottonian's began to lose influence. In §Y1014§! Saxony was invaded once more by the Franks and by §Y1020§! them and their allies were left dead or scattered. Suddenly for the first time in a generation, North Germany was free. It is in this precarious position that North Germany has persisted. With pagan raiders to the East and an ever vengeful Francia to the West, the states of North Germany were faced with boundless possible futures.\n\nAre they destined to unite against the Franks once more, dispose of the Carolingian Emperors and usher in a new Iron Century? Or are they to turn to the East, push the borders of Christendom and win eternal glory as warriors of Christ? Or, is the destiny of North Germany to persist in this fractured state, prey to larger powers for all time? It is up to the men of the day to choose their path and let the iron dice fall as they may."

The myriad of states that emerged from the chaos found themselves too small and fractured to avoid the prying eyes of §YCharlemagne§!. So, for a time, northern Italy lay under the complete control of the Franks. It wasn’t until the death of §YEmperor Bernard§! and the dismemberment of Francia that the northern Italian counts achieved their freedom once more.\n\nHowever, even in freedom they found trouble. Some princes, like the §YDoge of Venice§! and the §YCount of Lombardy§!, found themselves with vast domains, and soon the Lombards would leverage their advantage, uniting the Po Valley and expanding in all directions. But with the re-establishment of Carolingian power, the overextended Lombards would be fed to the wolves of Venice and their rebellious vassals. For the next few centuries, minor squabbles and encroaching Imperial power would be the main concern, but soon enough a new threat would arise.\n\nRe-established by the ambitious lords of Ifriqiya in the §Y1320s§, the §YEmirate of Sicily§! has steadily advanced northwards for generations. The Papal-led coalition of central Italian states failed to curb their rise in the §Y1340s§!, and in §Y1353§!, Naples and all of Southern Italy fell under Muslim domination. The Saracen armies have rapidly recovered from their wars and the Sultanate stands poised to take its most coveted prize yet: Rome itself.\n\n1444 finds Italy fractured; the various §YTuscan§! polities are rich but divided, the old and heirless count of §YRomagna§! risks a brutal succession dispute upon his death, and the vassal states of §Ythe Pope§! chafe at his ineptitude in fighting the Sicilians.

 string_start_title_carniola:0 "Princedom of Carniola"
 string_start_carniola:0 "Following the disintegration of §YSamo's Empire§!, a great unifying force for the early Slavs, one of the successor states was the §YPrincipality of Carantania§!. Stretching across much of Austria and Slovenia, it ruled proudly over what was the frontier between the Carolingian Empire and the Avars. However, following pressure from the Avars in 740, the prince of Carantania, §YBorut§!, appealed to the §YDuke of Bavaria§! for protection. This, in turn, made the Carantanians subjects of the growing §YCarolingian Empire§!. The Carantanians served faithfully as marches for the Frankish incursions into Pannonia to vanquish the Avars, but ultimately backed an ill-fated rebellion against the Franks by a Pannonian named Ljudevit Posavski.\n\nFollowing the §YRebellion of Ljudevit§!, the Carantanian princes were stripped of their titles and lost half of their land, demoted to dukes of §YCarinthia§! and §YCarniola§!. A new Germanic march was created in the former centre of Carantania that eventually became the §YDuchy of Styria§!, which has since been a thorn in the side of any Carniolan ruler who attempted to assert themselves beyond Carinthia. This disgrace to the former lords of Carantania has been largely ignored by the successive German rulers of the area, especially when the Franks regained control of the Empire. Carniola is merely viewed as an unusual but irrelevant member of the Empire, with much of its history long forgotten as the Empire grew and evolved.\n\nNow Carniola stands at a precipice. The §YBabenberg§! dynasty, once rulers of both Austria and Bavaria, have been diminished to ruling merely Styria, having Bavaria stripped away to the §YWittelsbachs§! and Tirol to the §YHabsburgs§!. Though nowhere near their former might, Styria presents a challenge to any aspiring Duke of Carniola seeking to restore Carantania to its former status. The Free City of §YTrieste§! also remains a thorn in the side of the Dukes of Carniola. Formerly a part of Carniola, it remains the most valuable port for commerce besides §YVenice§!, whose leaders also eye the Carniolan holdings greedily, were it not for the protection of the Empire.\n\nYet further beyond, rumours reach the Carniolan court of §YFrancia§! being in disarray following the disaster at §YValencia§!. Should they fail to solve the looming succession crisis, it may plunge the Holy Roman Empire into turmoil not seen in centuries. An ambitious ruler may see this as a time to strike out, laying claim to what was once rightfully theirs. Others still may wish to simply preserve what they have through the coming storm. The decision ultimately falls upon the sons of Prince Dragomir, relegated to a corner of the Empire, pondering whether they shall raise the banner of Carantania once more."
 string_start_title_piedmont:0 "The States of Piedmont"
 string_start_piedmont:0 "Bound to the Empire, Piedmont has always been at the crossroads between France, Germany, and Italy. Conquered along with the rest of the old Lombard kingdom by Charlemagne, various princes were appointed to govern the region, separating it from Lombardy proper. Piedmont would soon be forced into conflic; as the sickly and dying Carolingian emperor Bernard drew his last breath, his sons were gearing up for a brutal civil war, one that would tear the region asunder. One of these governors, a man named Anscar, supported the Saxons in opposition to the Franks, but upon their deposition his lands were partitioned, his line being reduced to Ivrea.\n\nThe 11th century saw the disintegration of formal power in the Alpine foothills, as robber barons, prince-bishops, and town councils fought against each other and against outside interference. It was during the Crusades that the victorious Aleramici of Asti, led by Count Giovanni the Brave, would use their spoils to wage a series of wars to unite Piedmont. The line of Anscar of Ivrea rose again from obscurity to oppose them, and soon the two houses became mortal enemies, locked in a titanic struggle for control of the region, playing out over centuries.\n\nInto this conflict strode the Grimaldi family, Genoese exiles who from their base in Monaco conquered Nice, ruling the Bishopric as a dynastic plutocracy. In 1291, they would formally enter the power struggle, marching on Torino just as the count of Ivrea had nearly capitulated Asti, forcing the region into an uneasy stalemate. The 14th century would thus be the first time Piedmont saw a protracted peace since the 800s, and new towns and villages sprung up to dot the foothills as trade flowed like wine from the vineyards of the land. This protracted peace was punctured by the Crusade of Valencia. Count Alessandro of Asti, seemingly secure in his pre-eminent position in Piedmont, promised Emperor Robert of Francia his total support, and soon the drums of war sounded, and the crusaders marched west. But all they found there was defeat, and, for the brave men of Asti, near-total anihilation. Alessandro won fame for his prowess but barely escaped with his life, and the ambitious Berengario of Ivrea would soon make him pay dearly. Swaying the Grimaldi with a hefty bribe, Berengario would corner the exhausted Asti regiment on its trek back to Piedmont and besiege Asti itself, forcing the beleaguered soldiers to capitulate.\n\nThe year is 1444, and Piedmont has a new hegemon, though one far from stable. Asti boils in unrest and Nice grows increasingly uneasy with their deal, while Ivrea looks to stablilize its hold. While peace is temporarily restored, it cannot last; the old King of Lombardy stirs once more, seeking to subjugate the North. Francia, reeling from the crusade, looks ready to collapse, and the fate of the Empire is at stake. Whether Piedmont can unite, seize the Iron Crown, and steer the Empire, or perhaps forge a new one, remains to be seen."
