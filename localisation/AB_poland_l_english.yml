 pol_pagan_rally_tribal_warriors_title:0 "Rally the Tribal Warriors"
 pol_pagan_rally_tribal_warriors_desc:0 "The fracturing of Poland into local tribes after folly of the Christian king Mieszko and his attempts to Christianise the realm, and the collapse of our once ally, the Great Moravian empire, has left us vulnerable and open to attack from all sides by heretics and heathens alike. We must rally the warriors and unify the Polish people once more!"
 pol_pagan_consolidate_silesia_title:0 "Consolidate Silesia"
 pol_pagan_consolidate_silesia_desc:0 "Silesia gained independence during the fall of Great Moravia. Although the Moravian kings attempted to Christianise Silesia, the highlands proved too arduous of a journey for the missionaries and were ultimately unsuccessful. It falls to us to protect them from the greedy hands of the Christian princes of the Holy Roman Empire."
 pol_pagan_sleza_title:0 "Sleza, the Holy Mountain"
 pol_pagan_sleza_desc:0 "Sleza has been the centrepiece of the Slavic worship, even before the shrines of our pantheon were built. The stone rings encircling our holy mountain and the mysterious animal sculptures dotting the mountainside existed before we settled these lands. As long as they exist, the Slavic faith will remain, and the strength our belief will never waver."
 pol_pagan_christians_title:0 "Purge the Christians"
 pol_pagan_christians_desc:0 "The Christians will always remain a threat to our ways - both external threats launching crusading campaigns into our homeland, and internal threats - like Mieszko - aiming to enthrone their legacy into history. They must be purged from our lands, or we will never be able to stand up to the wolves lurking in the shadows..."
 pol_pagan_shrines_title:0 "Shrines of the Old Gods"
 pol_pagan_shrines_desc:0 "The holy lands of the Slavic people have withstood the test of time, still and unchanging unlike the people who come before it. The shrines of the Old Gods remain as our link to the past in these uncertain times. We must preserve them at all costs."
 pol_pagan_perun_title:0 "Invoke Perun's Wrath"
 pol_pagan_perun_desc:0 "Perun, our almighty and supreme god. He who is of thunder and lightning, of oak and fire, and a god of warriors shall bless our swords and share his thunderous wrath with our dragoons. We shall invoke his patronage on those who dared to abandon him for false gods and pretentious idols. Invoke His wrath, and victory will come to us!"
 pol_pagan_crush_the_lendians_title:0 "Crush the Lendians"
 pol_pagan_crush_the_lendians_desc:0 "The Lendians, much like the foolish descendants of Mieszko ruling Greater Poland, turn to Christianity and evangelised much of their realm. However, unlike Mieszko's blood, they turned to the Eastern Orthodox Church instead in face of their Great Schism. Foreign support for the Lendians from their fellow believers will make them our biggest threat, so we must strike swiftly, and crush them now!"
 pol_pagan_end_bloodline_title:0 "End Mieszko's Bloodline"
 pol_pagan_end_bloodline_desc:0 "Though the rulers of Polans claim their descendancy of the only Polish king, Mieszko, it was his ambitions to Christianise the realm that ultimately lead to its demise. It is not out of the question that if they are left to their devices, they will attempt the same thing once more. The blood of our people is on their hands, and we should never deign to forget this!"
 pol_pagan_sons_of_lech_title:0 "Unite the Sons of Lech"
 pol_pagan_sons_of_lech_desc:0 "No matter how the recent times have unfolded, we should never forget that we were all children of Lech, one of the three legendary founders of the Slavic people. United by a shared history, the Polish people should once again become one. Let us unite the sons of Lech, and bring a new age for our people."
 pol_pagan_lechia_title:0 "Ascendant Lechia"
 pol_pagan_lechia_desc:0 "The reunification of the Polish people under the banner of Lechia has become a shining beacon in the darkness of these uncertain times. A resilient people, the children of Lech stand together for only the second time since the Piast king Mieszko. This time, we will remain steadfast in the name of Perun, and spurn any who dare to challenge that! Great King, ascendant Lechia!"
 pol_pagan_access_the_baltic_sea_title:0 "Access the Baltic Sea"
 pol_pagan_access_the_baltic_sea_desc:0 "Across the frigid waters of the Baltic Sea lies those who follow their own pantheons, very much similar to ours. Not only that, they are also under threat of Christian crusade under the banner of the Swedish king. Gaining access to the Baltic Sea through the Pomeralian lands will be of major priority if we wish to begin strategic talks with them."
 pol_pagan_naval_security_title:0 "Naval Security"
 pol_pagan_naval_security_desc:0 "With Gdansk secured, we have gained a major shipyard to begin constructing a naval fleet. These waters are plagued with raiding parties, and if we do not secure our own waters, our port towns will be the first to suffer, and the first to turn away from us."
 pol_pagan_secure_pomerania_title:0 "Control Pomerania"
 pol_pagan_secure_pomerania_desc:0 "Between us and our brothers in faith, the Wends, lies the Pomeranian people. Though they still follow the rule of Perun, there are many that have turned away to the Cross, no doubt under the pressure of missionaries from the neighbouring Baltic trade cities. If we are to unite our brothers, we will need to control this intermediary."
 pol_pagan_wendia_title:0 "Union with the Wends"
 pol_pagan_wendia_desc:0 "The Wendish people are undoubtedly the most resilient people in Europe. Pressed on all sides, they have resisted subjugation for centuries by heretics and heathens alike. The High Priest of Veleti is the spiritual leader of the Slavic faith, and any threat to them is a threat to us. A union with the Wends will be a blessing to both of our people and faith as one."
 pol_pagan_reconvert_moravia_title:0 "Reconvert Moravia"
 pol_pagan_reconvert_moravia_desc:0 "The once great Moravian empire spanned much of the West Slavs, including our own people. The first to convert away from the Slavic faith almost eons ago, The Moravian people are one of the most devout Christian believers in Eastern Europe. If we ever wish to assimilate them into our kingdom, we will need to reignite the flames of Perun upon the temple walls."
 pol_pagan_tame_the_czech_lion_title:0 "Tame the Czech Lion"
 pol_pagan_tame_the_czech_lion_desc:0 "The Czech people have withstood much turmoil and persevered through bitter war. No matter their faith, the exploits of the legendary Hussite general Jan Zizka earned the respect of all Slavs. Alienated by the Emperor and his ilk after the terrors of the Hussite Wars, there is a small opportunity for us to tame the Czech Lion."
 pol_pagan_invade_ruthenia_title:0 "Invade Ruthenia"
 pol_pagan_invade_ruthenia_desc:0 "The Ruthenian princes lie squabbling amongst themselves, all vying to claim the legacy of the once splendrous Kievan Rus'. Without unity, they are open to conquest, and the reclaiming of Kyiv will be imperative to reaffirm the Slavic faith throughout Eastern Europe."
 pol_pagan_proclaim_great_lechia_title:0 "Wielka Lechia"
 pol_pagan_proclaim_great_lechia_desc:0 "The name of Great Lechia echoes throughout Europe. Our banners soar from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea, from the holy Sleza to the Black Sea. A union of many cultures, from the remains of the Great Moravians and the Kievan Rus', the rising Intermarium is a blend of many legacies once past! Under our wonderous rule, the proclamation of the Wielka Lechia will signal the dawn of the Lechitic Empire!"
 pol_pagan_pruthenia_title:0 "Seize Pruthenia"
 pol_pagan_pruthenia_desc:0 "The Pruthenian people share close ties with our own, in both culture and Old God belief. Ruled by diplomatic tribal chiefs and kings but resistant to influence, recent religious turmoil in the Holy Roman Empire has exiled zealots to the fringes of Christendom, least of all the trade cities of Gdansk and Riga. Seizing Pruthenia for ourselves will prevent the Amber Road from falling into the hands of the greedy Hanseatic League."
 pol_pagan_subjugate_lithuania_title:0 "Lithuanian Subjugation"
 pol_pagan_subjugate_lithuania_desc:0 "The Lithuanians are the most powerful of the Baltic chiefdoms, having amassed a significant realm through diplomacy and war alike. Though respect can be given to their independence they are but a mere roadblock in our campaign to restore the prosperity of the Amber Road. They will not tolerate our beliefs nor willingly bow to our kings. The Lithuanians must be brought to heel!"
 pol_pagan_amber_road_title:0 "Expand the Amber Road"
 pol_pagan_amber_road_desc:0 "With the fracturing of beliefs away from the Old Gods and conflict between petty issues, much of the Amber Road has been left to decay and fallen into disuse. The seizure of Pruthenia has linked the northern terminus of the Amber Road with the central trade outposts in Poland under a single kingdom, ensuring lucrative trade profits for the realm if we deign to restore and expand the routes."
 pol_pagan_baltoslavic_union_title:0 "Balto-Slavic Union"
 pol_pagan_baltoslavic_union_desc:0 "As the last of the Estonian and Livonian banners fall, replaced with the great eagle of Lechia, the Baltic and Slavic people have been united as one! Though we are united in worship of the Old Gods, those of the Romuvan faith deign not to turn to Perun. If we are to maintain peace with the Baltic people, we must reconciliate our beliefs and respect their faith."
 pol_pagan_native_faith_church_title:0 "Church of the Native Faith"
 pol_pagan_native_faith_church_desc:0 "The churches of the Slavic faith are meagre homesteads compared to the lavish Christian cathedrals. It should come to no surprise that wayward believers can be fooled into thinking the Christian priesthood would share such wealth. As such,the rejuvenation of church land of our native faith should be a focus of the regime if we wish to strengthen the belief in Perun."
 pol_pagan_breadbasket_europe_title:0 "Breadbasket of Europe"
 pol_pagan_breadbasket_europe_desc:0 "The lands of Poland and south-western Ruthenia has always been the breadbasket of Europe, feeding those from Holland to Neva. With the ever looming threat of the Golden Horde, the Kievan granaries have been preserved for their own use in defense against the Mongol successors. As such, we remain the only plentiful source of grain in the region. If we do not sufficiently feed the people, they will look to take it for themselves..."
 pol_pagan_develop_countryside_title:0 "Develop the Countryside"
 pol_pagan_develop_countryside_desc:0 "Our lands have been battered, razed and dishevelled over the long centuries. It is nigh time that our people, our humble farmers and builders, know good fortune. Prosperity is within our reach, so long as we reach for it!"
 pol_pagan_support_mercantile_class_title:0 "Support the Merchants"
 pol_pagan_support_mercantile_class_desc:0 "We stand at a crossroads of trade. To the west, vile Christian Europe booms with prosperity and new innovations. To the east, riches and fantastical commodities flow from the mysterious reaches of the Silk Road. It is only right that we capitalise upon our position and enable both locals and strangers alike to do their business!"
 pol_pagan_urbanize_poland_title:0 "Urbanize Poland"
 pol_pagan_urbanize_poland_desc:0 "Battered as we are, we are resurgent. Our people are enjoying new heights of wealth, stability and prosperity, the likes of which many have never experienced before. We must capitalise on this new growth and burgeoning wealth - new cities, new urban centres, new localities, must rise from the ashes and become shining examples!"
 pol_pagan_splendor_of_capital_title:0 "Splendor of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 pol_pagan_splendor_of_capital_desc:0 "It is only right that [Root.Capital.GetName] stands alongside the beautiful metropolises of history! From Vilnius to Barlin, many capitals have shone and will continue to do so. It is only fitting that [Root.Capital.GetName] is among them and towers above all else!"
 pol_pagan_royal_palace_title:0 "Royal Palace"
 pol_pagan_royal_palace_desc:0 "Deep in [Root.Capital.GetName], our rulers conspire and plot for the betterment of our people, of the good bountiful Gods and of the savage warriors of the faith. With all our new wealth and resources, we can afford to make for ourselves a fitting palace that will draw the envy of the world."
 pol_pagan_increase_the_production_title:0 "Increase the Production"
 pol_pagan_increase_the_production_desc:0 "We would be fools not to capitalise upon the great plethora of goods within our very borders! Our land is fertile, our people are willing and our work ethic undeniable."
 pol_pagan_invest_in_manufactories_title:0 "Invest in Manufactories"
 pol_pagan_invest_in_manufactories_desc:0 "To keep up with the rest of Europe, we must forge ahead and establish bountiful manufactories across our realm. We must increase our means of industry tenfold if we hope to compete with our enemies!"
 pol_pagan_heavy_industry_title:0 "Polish Heavy Industry"
 pol_pagan_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Owing to the size and wealth of our realm, we have the opportunity to become an industrial powerhouse! Our expansive country, should we divert enough resources towards its industry, could rise above the rival powers of Europe and become a mighty producer of everything imaginable! When one thinks of the word 'industry', they shall think first of the Vistulans!"
 pol_pagan_wieliczka_title:0 "Wieliczka Salt Mine"
 pol_pagan_wieliczka_desc:0 "Deep beneath Krakow, the sprawling mines of Wieliczka lay waiting. Their potential is vast, untapped. Should we divert resources towards upgrading the mine's capacity, ensuring worker safety and optimal salt refinement, we could make of the mine a treasure trove, the likes of which will put competitors across Europe out of business." 
 pol_pagan_counterbalance_geography_title:0 "Outweigh Our Geography"
 pol_pagan_counterbalance_geography_desc:0 "Although the Old Gods have blessed us in many regards, they have certainly not blessed us when it comes to the geography of our nation. Its mostly flatland terrain is susceptible to being easily invaded, and we must counterbalance this harsh reality by fortifying ourselves."

 pol_orthodox_lendia_title:0 "The Birth of Lendia"
 pol_orthodox_lendia_desc:0 "As we turn our attention down towards the southern reaches of the Polish tribal regions, we shall subjugate the traditional Lendian regions and convert them to our faith so that they will become an integral part of our nation."

 pol_orthodox_novgorod_the_great_title:0 "Novgorod the Great"
 pol_orthodox_novgorod_the_great_desc:0 "To our north lies the region known as Novgorod. Its connection to the Baltic trade path as well as its potential of granting us access to Scandinavia through a lang route makes it a worthy target of conquest."

 pol_orthodox_tsar_of_rus_desc:0 "Having solidified our foothold in Russia, it is only appropriate that we lay claim to its entirety! We must announce to the Russian world that we are the hegemon that will defend them from encroachment. We are the rulers of Russia, protectors of the east!"
 pol_orthodox_unite_with_moravia_title:0 "Unite with Moravia"
 pol_orthodox_unite_with_moravia_desc:0 "The Moravians have long been a persitent rabble - fighting valiantly, admirably, for their place on the world stage, defending themselves against heretics and heathens alike, forging for themselves, on occasion, empires of their own. Today, they stand beaten and battered, ready to be subsumed by a greater power - namely, us." 
 pol_orthodox_tame_the_czech_lion_title:0 "Tame the Czech Lion"
 pol_orthodox_tame_the_czech_lion_desc:0 "Mighty Bohemia, a similarly admirable power, stands vulnerable. Religious infighting has fractured the country for long enough, as well as squabbles with the Catholics to the west and heathens to the north.

 pol_orthodox_encroach_on_the_empire_desc:0 "The bumbling and confused masses of the Holy Roman Empire stand vulnerable. With enough hammer blows, perhaps the entire system could fall apart - or, at the very least, come to acknowledge the error of their ways and see the light of Eastern Orthodoxy, however reluctant they may prove! The time has come for us to encroach upon the false empire."
 pol_orthodox_seek_religious_support_title:0 "Seek Religious Support"
 pol_orthodox_seek_religious_support_desc:0 "The current state of our political extent is laughable at best.

It is our moral prerogative to not only crush the Pruthenians and drive their heathenous faith into extinction, but to safeguard the German Catholics and place them within our protective hands. They will do much better under the holy guidance of Poland, all the safer and wealthier for it."

God intended for us to raise this city of stone and turn it into polished marble, and acting in accordance to His will, exactly that has been done. Now and forevermore, let the city of Gdansk be the capital of the Baltic Sea, glorious and prosperous for all to see!"
 pol_catholic_reconvert_moravia_title:0 "Reconvert Moravia"
 pol_catholic_reconvert_moravia_desc:0 "It is a tragic thing that our Orthodox brothers have taken the path of heresy. To forsake the temporal authority of the Pope in Rome is no easy decision, yet it paves the way for Christendom's fall, and for immorality to take root in society, as the enemies of God are many, and one cannot afford even more divison.\n\n... But that is alright. The Moravian Christians, for as rigorous as they believe their faith in the Orthodox Church to be, will soon understand the error of their ways, and the plight and suffering they bring by their stubborn refusal to bend the knee to the Pope. Such a revelation will quickly push them back towards the true light."
 pol_catholic_wenceslas_title:0 "Crown of Saint Wenceslas"
 pol_catholic_wenceslas_desc:0 "The Czechs are a troubled, confused, and lost people. They have struggled with their identity against the influence of German culture and politics that have forced them to concede time and time again, crawling back for their protection against the Magyars, the Moravians, and even our own, sadly pagan, brothers. The last in this long line of tragedies has been the Hussite movement, yet another call of devilry and heresy that wishes to split and fracture Christ's followers so that the enemy may have an easier time destroying us. This will not stand, and we will certainly not let it continue. Whether the Crown of Bohemia will be an equal in our kingdom, or a part of our dominion, it matters not - the Lion's Throne will be secured, and our Czech brothers saved from sin."

 pol_catholic_advance_into_ruthenia_desc:0 "It is Poland's fate not only to unify her own people, and drive out the heathens of the north, but to look east and gaze upon the sea of lost men. The sons of Rus know not what they do, struggling to find their faith as all around them they are assailed by murderous pagans and strange, alluring, yet evil faiths. Their insistence of isolating themselves from Catholic Europe will be their downfall, and it is only our intervention that can stop such an egregious act. They may yet see the truth."

Instead, they would rather wallow for eternity, doomed to irrelevance and the hellfire that awaits them in the next life. Their sad display has forced us to act - we know how easily the Pruthenians were swayed by our honeyed words, and just the same will happen to the Lithuanians. Once their lands are ours, and their people ours, it will be a short march away before all the Baltics have been liberated from Romuvan paganism."

They may not speak our language, and at first wish to even be ruled by us, but in time they will understand the severity of their own plight, and will thank us for our kindness in saving their souls from damnation. Conveniently, beyond the extensive benefits this gives us in our mercantile matters, it serves as a staging grounds for an invasion into the lands of Novgorod, and such an opportunity will not be wasted. To arms!"

After all, if we can turn the Rus to our side of salvation and mercy, and establish a new, Polish-dominant empire in these vast lands, then Catholicism will be unstoppable."

 polestablishsejm:0 "Establish the Sejm"
 polestablishsejm_desc:0 "While the Crown of Poland has long relied on its estates for the administration of our nation, this has, legally speaking, been largely informal and done through irregular, archaic diets. To this, we say: no longer! By establishing the Sejm as an official legislative branch of our government and by including the Szlachta, Clergy, and Burghers, we can ensure the smooth running of our government."
 polempowertribal:0 "Empower the Old Tribal Leaders"
 polempowertribal_desc:0 "While the culture of our fair nation is now united, some old tribal lines are still drawn among the population, memories of days prior to the unification of our state. Rather than trying to suppress this, it would seem that by empowering the Christianized Pagans and the previously Catholic nobles in the northwest, we can ensure further unity within our state."
 polpolishpatriarchate:0 "Establish the Polish Patriarchate"
 polpolishpatriarchate_desc:0 "Now that we have secured Poland's lands for the one true faith, it would seem only reasonable to establish our own autocephalous Patriarchate, separate from those to the south and east. By doing so, we are sure to increase the influence and loyalty of the Church within our borders while also aiding us in our diplomacy with fellow nations of the true faith."

 ab_poland.3.t:0 "The Birth of Lendia" #Orthodox Unification of Poland
 ab_poland.3.d:0 "When Mieszko's kingdom collapsed as a result of his foolish actions and the ignorance of the tribal chieftains, Poland was immolated upon its own burning stake. The Lendian tribes were spared, isolated from the infighting from fortunate geography. As they watched the horrors committed by both, they turned to another faith entirely. With the support of the Ruthenian princes and the legacy of the Great Moravians, the Lendian people were welcomed to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Empowered by the monolith of belief in Eastern Europe, we were able to extinguish the infighting and efface the horrors. Under the name of Lendia and with the teachings of Cyril and Methodius, the Polish people will found a new path!"

 ab_poland.4.t:0 "The Third Rome" #Orthodox Polish Tsardom
 ab_poland.4.d:0 "As we outgrew the bustling woodland home that had once given our people warmth, we saw what the other lands had to offer. A false Empire lies in the west, piddling margraves squabbling over meagre trophies pilfered from peaceful Slavic towns. To the east and beyond are what can only be described as barbarians, brutes who seek to destroy civilisation - if only to bring others to match their own deficiency. Though we stand united under the Patriarchates, we are each splinters, a brittle phalanx hammered without pause. To become something greater, the idea of a pan-Slavic union bonding the brothers of the Eastern Orthodox faith was put forth. With infighting desecrating the heart of the Orthodox Church, they will turn to us for refuge and hospice. We will forge a new Rome; a Third Rome!"

 ab_poland.5.t:0 "Ascendant Lechia" #Pagan Unification of Poland
 ab_poland.5.d:0 "The reunification of the Polish people under the banner of Lechia has become a shining beacon in the darkness of these uncertain times. A resilient people, the children of Lech stand together for only the second time since the Heathen king Mieszko. His desperate ploy to prevent attacks from German margraves and centralise his own power by converting to Catholicism had disastrous consequences, when our decisive chieftains rejected his decrees. \n\n It stands as our eternal duty to protect and unite those who share in the blessings of Perun, and materialise the strength the Old Gods have blessed us with. Like those who stood before us, we will remain loyal to Perun and Weles, and spurn any who dare to challenge that! Great King, ascendant Lechia!"
 ab_poland.5.a:0 "We are all children of Lechia. Thy mighty Perun, may you give us strength!"
 ab_poland.6.t:0 "Great Lechia" #Pagan Intermarium
 ab_poland.6.d:0 "Once, we were but a tiny tribe that dreamed of the ebbing seas. A fragment of desperate mistakes, a piece of something greater. As we sought to protect the quivering flames of the Old Gods, we achieved and spread our roots further than ever before. As our kingdom grew, so did our ambitions; the temples of the Old Gods spanned all of Eastern Europe, and we reclaimed what we lost centuries ago. Now, the name Great Lechia echoes throughout Europe. Our banners soar from the North Sea to the Baltic, from the holy Sleza to the Black Sea. A union of many cultures, manifesting from the remains of the Great Moravians and the Kievan Rus', the rising Intermarium is a blend of many legacies once past! Under our wondrous rule, the proclamation of the Wielka Lechia will signal the dawn of the Lechitic Empire!"

 ab_poland.7.t:0 "Legacy of Mieszko" #Catholic Unification of Poland
 ab_poland.7.d:0 "Poland has been the outpost of Catholicism in the East ever since King Mieszko I was baptized in the Western Latin Rite in 966 AD, and his successors swore alleagiance to the Holy See. The dastardly tribal chieftains rejected Catholic missions under the banner of Piast, and instead banded together to plunge the kingdom into civil war. We retreated to our seat of power in Poznan, knowing that enemies were on all sides. Proving to be a sagacious move, the chieftains returned to squabbling between each other in idiocy. With Papal blessing to remove the archaic beliefs of an unenlightened people, our armies struck swiftly and aimed true, felling the tribes once and for all. We will learn from our mistakes to restore the honour of House [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and the legacy of Mieszko!"

 ab_poland.8.t:0 "An Empire Between the Seas" #Catholic Intermarium
 ab_poland.8.d:0 "When we first reclaimed our legacy and restored what was lost in civil strife, the Polish people were at a loss. They had fought so fiercely in reviving Mieszko's kingdom, there was never a plan for what came after. The vision of the Intermarium was birthed when the Pope expressed a desire to return Eastern Europe into the purview of the Roman Catholic Church, once lost to the Eastern Orthodox Church following the events of the Great Schism. With God's will, we crusaded against heathens and heretics alike, bringing forth the light of Catholicism to the endless woodlands and plentiful grazing lands spanning Eastern Europe. Now, we have reached the bounds of the Earth itself, reaching from the frigid Baltic to the temperate Black Sea. Those who have lost their way have rediscovered the torch-lit path, and those who traveled another path entirely have been apprised of a better one. Armed with new brothers and sisters in faith, who shall dare stand against us?"

 ab_poland.9.t:0 "Arrival of the Hussites"
 ab_poland.9.d:0 "When our great King Mieszko first converted to Catholicism against the wishes of the Slavic chieftains all those centuries ago, the unity of the Roman Catholic Church was undoubtedly stronger than it was today. However, with the Great Schism irrevocably tearing Christendom in two, there are many who have questioned if either were the right path at all. The writings and proclamations of Jan Hus brought many of these questions to the forefront, adding fuel to the raging inferno upon the Western Schism between Rome and Avignon. We watched the horrors and untold devastation wrought during the Hussite Wars, and now that no mattter how we align as brothers in faith, these cursed Catholic margraves will kill, burn and pillage just the same as they would to any heathen town.\n\nThe Bohemian declaration of Jan Hus' teachings to be part of the state religion has brought many of their theologians and missionaries across the grasslands into Poland, to convince us to do the same. We must decide now; should we attempt set the example for these wayward Catholics and become their lightbearer? Or shall we follow in the teachings of Jan Hus, and rejoin our Slavic brothers in the fight against the Roman Catholic Church's failings?"
