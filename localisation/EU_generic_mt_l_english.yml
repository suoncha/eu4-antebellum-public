 eu_generic_industrialize_the_economy_title:0 "Industrialise the Economy"
 eu_generic_industrialize_the_economy_desc:0 "With our resources secure and our economy booming, rapid advances in all things are beginning to coalesce. Lucrative new ways to improve our production are being discovered at lightning speed, and if we are to continue our economic dominance, we must continue to integrate these ideas and inventions into our society."
 eu_generic_increase_the_production_title:0 "Increase the Production"
 eu_generic_increase_the_production_desc:0 "If we are to become an economic powerhouse, we must be able to exploit our resources to the fullest. It is for this reason that we should invest heavily in our province's ability to produce both raw and finished goods, allowing us to make great strides against our rivals."
 eu_generic_build_buildings_title:0 "Build Buildings"
 eu_generic_build_buildings_desc:0 "Now that we have established a stable income, finding something to invest in is the next step towards greatness. Using this wealth to build up our infrastructure would be a wise decision."
 eu_generic_high_income_title:0 "High Income"
 eu_generic_high_income_desc:0  "If we wish to make something of our realm, improving our income is a good first step. This should allow us to eventually reinvest this new found wealth into more important and long lasting programs."
 eu_generic_build_a_treasury_title:0 "Build a Treasury"
 eu_generic_build_a_treasury_desc:0 "We have drastically improved the financial well being of our realm, through proper fiscal management and investments. Now we should look to stockpile some of this wealth for safe keeping in case darker times fall on us."
 eu_generic_envy_of_the_world_title:0 "Envy of the World"
 eu_generic_envy_of_the_world_desc:0 "Wealth beyond our wildest dreams flows into our realm - the hard-earned honey of our conquests enriching our coffers. Now, it is time we give back to the world, by improving upon our capital once more. Towers to reach the skies, canals to channel the seas, cathedrals to make all who are wicked and unholy shiver... By erecting these, we shall make our capital the envy of the whole world!"
 eu_generic_a_worthy_capital_title:0 "A Worthy Capital"
 eu_generic_a_worthy_capital_desc:0 "Dotting beautiful Europe are constellations of cities magnificent, their names embedded in history. Paris, Berlin, Rome, Vienna... it is only appropriate that our capital be mentioned among them! Thus, we must double, triple its size and grandeur if need be, until it is a marvel for all to behold."
 eu_generic_expand_nation_title:0 "Expand [Root.GetName]"
 eu_generic_expand_nation_desc:0 "Our men yearn for conquest! Our borders can hardly contain our burgeoning might. We must set forth, expand our realm, announce to our neighbours that we are not to be trifled with!"
 eu_european_imperial_conquest_title:0 "Imperial Conquest"
 eu_european_imperial_conquest_desc:0 "We have expanded far beyond our initial borders. Scabby towns, dirty villages and whimsical farmlands no longer concern us. Instead, we eye foreign capitals. We eye unfamiliar plains. We eye mountains once thought impervious to mortal instruments. We now have imperial ambitions… plans to consume and dominate the world itself!"
 eu_generic_european_great_power_title:0 "European Great Power"
 eu_generic_european_great_power_desc:0 "The petty concerns of local politics and rival lords no longer bother us. We have transcended our former insignificance, climbed the European order. The most powerful families in Europe now eye us with intrigue, watching carefully our next moves. We must seize the opportunity to prove ourselves to Europe - we are a power great, a power to be feared!"
 eu_generic_unite_home_region_title:0 "Unite Home Region"
 eu_generic_unite_home_region_desc:0 "Our home region, torn asunder by the petty vendettas of feudal houses, is finally united under our banner. Our neighbours would be right to fear us, dreading the moment we set our gaze upon gleaming jewels to pry from Europe’s diadem. Years from now, chroniclers shall say that here stands the heartland of a mighty empire - our empire!"
 eu_generic_eclipse_the_neighbours_title:0 "Eclipse the Neighbours"
 eu_generic_eclipse_the_neighbours_desc:0 "From humble beginnings, we have fought tooth and nail to rise above our peers. Indeed, our neighbours were right to fear us and our potential. Clawing at every advantage, seizing upon every opportunity, they never stood a chance. Now, at long last, we have eclipsed our neighbours’ place in the sun, and proudly consider it our own."
 eu_generic_build_to_force_limit_title:0 "Build to Force Limit"
 eu_generic_build_to_force_limit_desc:0 "If we are to expand our power and prestige, so too must the army’s ranks swell. By wielding a big enough stick, we will secure the means to project sufficient force behind our gambits, and in doing so make our enemies think twice about challenging us!"
 eu_generic_efficient_administration_title:0 "Efficient Administration"
 eu_generic_efficient_administration_desc:0 "As our apparatus of state grows, so too do the cracks in the system. If we are to live long and prosper on the world stage, our burgeoning nation must adapt to the onslaught of issues which stymie it. By slashing unnecessary expenditure, and reassigning postings to adept statesmen, we will streamline the administration into a bureaucratic powerhouse!"
 eu_generic_conquer_new_states_title:0 "Conquer New States"
 eu_generic_conquer_new_states_desc:0 "Despite its unprecedented prosperity, our nation is always hungry for more; More conscripts for the army, more land for cultivation, more resources to feed the fires of industry! The nations around us are brimming with such bounty, yet they sit idly atop it. By carving out a fortune from these states, our country’s needs would be sated for years to come. If we rattle our sabre enough, the people will surely cry for conquest, and who are we to deny them their wish?"
 eu_generic_acquire_subjects_title:0 "Acquire Subjects"
 eu_generic_acquire_subjects_desc:0 " "How can a realm be considered superior without having subordinates who will view it as such? The answer is that it cannot. It is for this reason that we must seek to build up our powerbase through client states, whether this be through diplomacy or conquest, it matters not."
 eu_generic_reform_the_army_title:0 "Reform the Army"
 eu_generic_reform_the_army_desc:0 "If we are to be seen as a major power in Europe, we must have an army worthy of one. Long past are the days of small feudal levies led by ill equipped nobles. We must reform this system and build a more professional army, if we are to survive and weather our enemies. Let us build an army worthy of [Root.GetName]."
 eu_generic_military_doctrine_title:0 "Military Doctrine"
 eu_generic_military_doctrine_desc:0 "A jack of all trades is a master in none. It is for this reason that we must decide on a more specialised set of tactics and innovations for our army to focus on. Our army has fought in many battles now and we should use this experience to our benefit. Let us choose an area of expertise for our armed forces to specialise in."
 eu_generic_bolster_the_defences_title:0 "Bolster the Defences"
 eu_generic_bolster_the_defences_desc:0 "A good offence is only as good as our defence allows. What good is it to win a battle if the enemy can ravage our cities? The decaying castles that dot our landscape no longer provide enough defence to be useful. Upgrading and building new fortresses will allow us to continue to thrive without worry of attack."
 eu_generic_imperial_army_title:0 "Imperial Army"
 eu_generic_imperial_army_desc:0 "Dark clouds now encircle all of Europe, and large scale conflicts now seem inevitable. Yet our glorious army shall rise to the cause and meet our enemies head on! Its superior size, tactics and discipline shall carry us into a new era of dominance and power."
 eu_generic_renaissance_title:0 "Embrace the Renaissance"
 eu_generic_renaissance_desc:0 "A rebirth in classical values and ideals has begun to take shape in Italy. By rediscovering classical works on literature, art, philosophy and music, a new form of humanism has become widely popular amongst all of Europe. New humanist scholars are now discussing better ways to run a state, based on Greek and Roman models. We should seek to grant our patronage to these renaissance scholars, to better manage our government and society."
 eu_generic_printing_press_title:0 "The Printing Press"
 eu_generic_printing_press_desc:0 "A revolution in the mass production of books and writing has allowed an exponential increase in the availability of knowledge to the whole of christian Europe. New ideas, both dangerous and powerful, are being formulated at an increasingly fast pace. We must capitalise on this and begin the process of establishing state-run printing shops to better disseminate our ideals on society as a whole."
 eu_generic_educate_the_nation_title:0 "Educate the Nation"
 eu_generic_educate_the_nation_desc:0 "It is regrettable that a vast majority of our subjects lack the ability to read and write, or even perform more than rudimentary counting. The remedy to this is expanding the education framework of the state, and if we are to make a serious attempt at waging war on illiteracy, then no cost can be too high."
 eu_generic_enlightened_rule_title:0 "Enlightened Rule"
 eu_generic_enlightened_rule_desc:0 "Ours is not a nation of unwashed philistines, suffocating in the cage of vulgar barbarity. No, we are an enlightened state with a ruler to match. [Root.Monarch.GetName], lawmaker and patron of the arts, is on the cutting edge of pursuits both cultured and scholarly, guiding us to brilliance with a firm hand and sharp mind."
 eu_generic_trustworthy_allies_title:0 "Trustworthy Allies"
 eu_generic_trustworthy_allies_desc:0 "The European stage is as hazardous to a nation as it is rewarding, often finding itself littered with shattered ambitions and allies with crossed fingers. While we can almost certainly navigate the perils of this great play as a sole performer, having dependable and loyal allies - if even for a few short years - would prove a great boon. Should we find a nation willing to stand by us and our own, we too shall stand by it and theirs!"
 eu_generic_a_grand_alliance_title:0 "A Grand Alliance"
 eu_generic_a_grand_alliance_desc:0 "Our nation finds itself stranded in a vast ocean of rivals, all of them snapping at its heels like starving sharks. While we have previously sought out allies to rally to our aid, wisdom dictates that we should align ourselves to even more willing bulwarks, lest we be overcome. May this Grand Alliance withstand the test of time, and see us ever victorious!"
 eu_generic_wealth_of_india_title:0 "Wealth of India"
 eu_generic_wealth_of_india_desc:0 "An antique land called home by countless people and the warring states they serve, India also harbours immense wealth, the likes of which only a handful of European states have ever seen. Exotic spices, precious metals, glistening gems - what is there to benefit us, which the Indians do not possess? What we can trade for, we shall acquire at a fair price, but if we can’t? Well, we won’t hesitate to wield a big stick from time to time..."
 eu_generic_naval_capacity_title:0 "Increase the Naval Capacity"
 eu_generic_naval_capacity_desc:0 "Our fleet can almost certainly hold its own in home waters, but beyond that it would wind up overextended, and whittled down by pirates or worse like ticks on a bull’s flank. If we are to project our naval might across the seas, from the Hanseatic Ports, to the Spanish Main and beyond, we must allocate additional funding towards the fleet’s capacity. More shipyards and port recruiters will give us the ships we need, and the crews to man them."
 eu_generic_rule_the_waves_title:0 "Rule the Waves"
 eu_generic_rule_the_waves_desc:0 "As if caught in a great maelstrom, any fleet which vies against ours for dominance will find itself dashed to splinters, their mighty oaken hearts lost to the depths. Soon, all the world’s great navies shall tremble before our colours unfurled upon the high seas, the sails billowing in a raging tempest, and cannonfire a roaring thunder to match. For generations to come, sailors and shorebound alike will sing ‘[Root.GetName], Rule the Waves!’"
 eu_generic_african_bases_title:0 "African Bases"
 eu_generic_african_bases_desc:0 "Owing to Africa’s immense size, circumnavigation is a strenuous affair. Diseases ravage the continent, shorelines are often unfriendly and locals are of middling loyalties - some adhering to Allah, while others totter towards the light of the lord. It would be wise of us to set up minor bases of operations, safe ports, along the African coastlines, so that our brave sailors may have places to rest on their treacherous voyages."
 eu_generic_spice_isles_title:0 "Reach the Spice Isles"
 eu_generic_spice_isles_desc:0 "On the other side of the world, where one can find hot and humid lands frightful and ferocious, most marvellous delicacies await. Spices rich and dazzling, farmed by the multitude, lay in wait, sold to the highest bidders. If we were to establish bases of control in their midst, these exotic spices would be ours to covet and trade..."
 eu_generic_construct_a_fleet_title:0 "Construct a Fleet"
 eu_generic_construct_a_fleet_desc:0 "No nation is complete without a fleet! Those who hold us in contempt would be most content to batter and shatter our shorelines with their shiny new cannons. We must beat them to it - we must set sail, put forth ships that will make our enemies tremble!"
 eu_generic_discover_new_world_title:0 "Discover the New World"
 eu_generic_discover_new_world_desc:0 "Many an ancient text describes vast and fantastical lands beyond the pillars of Atlas. To the great unknown west, where the sun does set, it is said that a land bountiful, a land unclaimed, lays in wait - if only one were to strike forth and claim it. Set sail - a New World awaits!"
 eu_generic_settle_the_americas_title:0 "Settle the Americas"
 eu_generic_settle_the_americas_desc:0 "Sprawling before us are lands ripe and fertile. With ease, we could cast our burgeoning lot across the seas and claim these lands for ourselves! Founding new nations, colonies in essence, is all the rage nowadays. From their lands and into our coffers, riches shall flow!"
 eu_generic_colonial_administration_title:0 "Colonial Administration"
 eu_generic_colonial_administration_desc:0 "One colony will not do. Not even two shall suffice! We must have beneath us an entire network of colonies - trade routes wisely and sufficiently plotted, governors appointed and ordained, councils presided over and empowered. A colonial administration is what we must possess!"
 eu_generic_transatlantic_empire_title:0 "Transatlantic Empire"
 eu_generic_transatlantic_empire_desc:0 "The vast and boundless Atlantic, on which history is rapidly unfolding, like a great stage for the world’s events to unfold, awaits us. It is only fitting that we make of ourselves a tight-knit oceanic empire, with interwoven colonies working in tandem to keep the ocean secure, within our control, within our interests. A transatlantic empire we shall be!"

 eu_generic.1.d:0 ""By our diligent and steadfast efforts, by the countless rivers of blood our men have shed unto the Earth, by the innumerable fortress walls laid waste to by ravenous cannons and gallant charges alike, we have extended our nation’s might tenfold. Foreign tongues now clamour beneath our banners. Merchants of all faiths speak with reverence of our benevolent, encompassing reign. Philosophers and intellectuals across all of Europe nod to us when making reference to the ‘empires of modernity’. It is true - like the eternal Rome or the formidable Persia, our nation now stands as an empire, an undeniable cornerstone of not only global politics, but history itself."

Even now many question if we should use our new found production capabilities to focus on producing different kinds of trade goods in our capital. Perhaps we should look to producing goods that will stand a better chance of generating profit in the future."

 eu_generic.3.t:0 "The Renaissance" 
 eu_generic.3.d:0 "Between the 15th and 16th Centuries AD, a movement known as the Renaissance would spread across Europe and transform its cultural, scholarly, philosophical, and aesthetic landscapes forever. Having originated in Italy, this period is often attributed to Greek intellectuals fleeing from the encroaching Turks, the politics and quirks of northern Italy, and perhaps more importantly, the patronage of powerful dynasties such as the Medici. As a consequence of newly resurfaced ancient art, texts, and treatises, Renaissance men harkened back to Classical Antiquity for inspiration, caught in a whirlwind of humanism, reason, and classicist nostalgia. Faith, reality, and the natural world would become focal points of this movement, ushering in an age of curiosity, extravagance, and radical change." 
 eu_generic.3.a:0 "Rome is back in fashion!" 
 eu_generic.4.t:0 "The Printing Press" 
 eu_generic.4.d:0 "While printing technology had existed in Europe in a rudimentary form for several centuries, it was not until Johannes Gutenberg unveiled his eponymously named Gutenberg movable type press in AD 1440 that it became widespread. Through refining and expanding upon the manual screw presses which were available in Germany and elsewhere, Gutenberg facilitated a system of mass printing at low cost, rendering the low output and costly methods which preceded it obsolete. Within mere years, the printing press would take hold across Europe, revolutionising the way information was communicated and disseminated. The printing press was responsible for the widespread release of Martin Luther’s tracts, facilitating the Protestant Reformation, but also introduced many secular works to the world, like Sir Thomas Malory’s ‘Le Morte d’Arthur’ - published by William Caxton as one of England’s earliest book printing endeavours." 
 eu_generic.4.a:0 "You can’t stop this press!" 
 eu_generic.5.t:0 "The Enlightenment" 
 eu_generic.5.d:0 "Brought about by the culmination of scientific and philosophical thought up until then, the Enlightenment was a movement dedicated to the development and proliferation of rational, scientific, and especially secular thought. Gripping Europe between the 17th and 19th Centuries, many scholars and thinkers, ranging from Locke to Hobbes, and Descartes to Voltaire published equally numerous literary and scientific works within the umbrella of the Enlightenment. This new era of rationalist doctrine permanently eroded the power of religion over the population within Western Europe, and at its ultimate conclusion, ushered in radically new ideologies which would sweep away much of the Ancien Regimes as soon as the 18th Century, bringing about a far more familiar political and philosophical landscape." 
 eu_generic.5.a:0 "Cogito, ergo sum"
