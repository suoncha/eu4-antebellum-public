 rum_elephants_title:0 "Reintroduce War Elephants"
 rum_elephants_desc:0 "Our army's efficacy has reached new heights. Intelligence, boldness, power and determination - our armies are known for these traits, led now by generals with decades of experience, fashioned into hordes of fearsome Cataphracts and brutal infantry. With this restored might, it is only fitting that we restore yet another pillar of our fallen legacy - the dreaded war elephant. The bones of our enemies shall be pounded to dust beneath their might!"
 rum_immortals_title:0 "Revive the Immortals"
 rum_immortals_desc:0 "Our proud history has been muddied and diluted over time. Legends stand out however - paramount among them, that of the Immortals. Recalled by ancient Persian and Roman scholars alike, the Immortals were fierce heavy infantry of great standing, numbering 10,000 at any given time, no more, no less. In service, they guarded not only our ruler, but the empire as a whole. With our military might and burgeoning empire, it seems right that we revive this legend and make our enemies cower!"
 rum_textile_industry_title:0 "Persian Textile Industry"
 rum_textile_industry_desc:0 "Our textile industry, chief in all of the East, is world-renowned, but it risks being overshadowed by English or Iberian manufactories lest we subsidise it heavily."
 rum_terminus_title:0 "Terminus of the Silk Road"
 rum_terminus_desc:0 "Egypt is in our grasp and our empire greets the Mediterranean with open arms, welcoming its riches and eager merchants as if they were old friends. This has not come without issue, however - greedy Europeans have leapt at the chance to exploit the turmoil, slipping into a kind of economic power vacuum to garner as much wealth as possible. We must have none of it - Aleppo and Alexandria bow to US, it is OUR coin which reigns here! Only through Persia can the lifeblood of the Silk Road be ferried!"
 rum_nahrawan_title:0 "Improve the Nahrawan"
 rum_nahrawan_desc:0 "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."

 per_mongoltactic_title:0 "Adopt Mongol Tactics"
 per_mongoltactic_desc:0 "A wise man once recounted that we must learn from our enemies - especially those triumphant. The fearsome Mongol ways harken back to those of old, of the Parthians and the steppe warriors of before. We must concede and forget our pride just this once - learn where we went wrong so that we must not fall again. Saddle up!"
 per_army_title:0 "Gond-i Shah"
 per_army_desc:0 "The wretched Ilkhanate has fallen - their foul-breathed elites retreating into the Caucasus like the rats they are. They have left Persia in tatters, reduced to squabbling houses and raving mystics. We would be fools to ignore our surplus of manpower and fateful positioning - Persia is ours for not only the taking, but the rebuilding!"
 per_divided_title:0 "A House Divided"
 per_divided_desc:0 "We have emerged from turmoil and established ourselves as a figurehead. Our neighbours gaze upon us with newfound respect - and if not respect, fear. Having recovered from the brutality of the Mongols, risen to great heights in spite of it, our proud house is well on its way towards proving itself worthy of Persian hegemony. Let us reach for it!"
 per_princes_title:0 "Princes of Persia"
 per_princes_desc:0 "Persia has fallen into disunity. Centuries of abuse and conflict have reduced our peoples, varying and middling as they are, to pathetic rivalries. On all sides, we are surrounded by bickering fools - fools which stand in the way of a prosperous, united Persia. Let us exercise our diplomatic muscles and prove that we are the heirs of our mighty ancestors."
 per_cataphracts_title:0 "Modernise the Cataphracts"
 per_cataphracts_desc:0 "The Cataphracts - mounted warriors and hoofed beasts plated all over in the finest metal armour - were a staple of old Persia. Cataphracts struck fear in the hearts of our rivals of old, shattering Roman legions and rebel rabble alike with impunity. So successful were they that the remnant Romans of later ages adopted our tactics, seeking to copy us - admittedly, to great effect. Let us revive this monster of the battlefield!"

 per_iran_title:0 "Iran-e Bozorg"
 per_iran_desc:0 "We are ascendant. Our neighbours have crumbled - either falling into our sphere of influence or falling into the raging waters of history, fading just like a thousand other silly warlords. With our strength insurmountable and our horizons broadening by the day, the total reclamation of Persia is within sight. Onward!"
 per_ilkhanate_title:0 "Execute the Ilkhan"
 per_ilkhanate_desc:0 "Fallen and dilapidated as they are, the steppe fiends persist in their malice, exercising cruelty over the valleys of the Caucasus. They seek to bide their time - waiting for a new moment to raze, plunder and oppress. This cannot come to pass. Every last Mongol warlord must be brought to heel - so that Mongol rule, in the mind of every peasant, far and near, may become but a distant memory."
 per_secure_gulf_title:0 "Secure the Coastline"
 per_secure_gulf_desc:0 "The Persian Gulf is a den of trade. Merchants from far and wide traverse its rocky coastlines to ferry the whimsical riches of India to the proud zealots of the Levant. As a result, it has rich maritime foundations, as well as well-worn, critical defensive positions and valuable ports. Securing the southern coastline will grant us naval supremacy over our regional rivals."
 per_recover_meshan_title:0 "Recover Meshan"
 per_recover_meshan_desc:0 "Shy of our most recent coastal acquisitions is Meshan - the gates to old Mesopotamia and the twin rivers of the Tigris and the Euphrates. Establishing a foothold will establish for us a monopoly - a mercantile handhold which we can grip, squeeze, clench, wrangle every last coin and gem from. Meshan must return to our fold - so that our neighbours may know true hunger, true poverty, and beg for our overlordship."
 per_monopolize_title:0 "Monopolise the Gulf"
 per_monopolize_desc:0 "With the southern coastline in our grip, we may begin to compete with the wily Hormuzi and the bold Hindus. Should we strengthen our mercantile muscles, empower our regional merchants and secure trade within the region, we could easily dominate the Gulf's commerce and establish an unbreakable monopoly for centuries to come."
 per_gerrha_title:0 "Claim Gerrha"
 per_gerrha_desc:0 "To the south of Meshan is Gerrha - a vital Arabian coastline, rife with fierce commercial competition. For centuries, the Khaleeji of Arabia have competed valiantly with our native merchants - but no more, we say. With our resurgent strength, we may conquer and assimilate this region, making it a vital addition to our blossoming trade empire."
 per_mazun_title:0 "Conquer Mazun"
 per_mazun_desc:0 "A symbolic victory is in sight. Mazun, heartland of the Khaleeji, the Hormuzi merchants our empire tirelessly competes against, sits at our feet. Helpless and petty, they may fall to our efforts - and with the tip of Arabia in our grasp, a monopoly, a domination outright of the Indian Ocean, could be within our grasp, securing our place in the world as a naval hegemon to be feared."
 per_consolidate_title:0 "Consolidate the Realm"
 per_consolidate_desc:0 "Persia has fallen beneath our banner. Its totality sits within our grasp - every valley gouged into the ancient earth, every arid desert settlement sitting eternally on the outskirts of civilised life, they all fall under our influence - yet they do not kneel. Separatist sentiment, radicalised peasantry and rampant disorganisation must be quelled. Our subjects must learn their place!" 
 per_seat_title:0 "Seat of the Shahanshah"
 per_seat_desc:0 "Persia bows before us, yet our capital does not stand as high as it should. From the hot sands of Cairo to the distant silk-laden east, it is known that marvellous, empowering capitals spring up where rightful, legitimate kings reign. We must waste no more time - our Shahanshah deserves a proper capital!"
 per_tribes_title:0 "Subjugate the Tribes"
 per_tribes_desc:0 "To the north, chaos reigns. Since time immemorial, fiendish savages have reigned over the steppe. Once in a blue moon, wise and humble peoples come forth from the maws of history to provide us with splendid company, but this cannot be counted upon. The steppe is dangerous and so are its inhabitants. We'd best bring the fight to them and subjugate their energies, lest they bring the fight to us."
 per_silk_title:0 "Follow the Silk Road"
 per_silk_desc:0 "To the east, the intrepid Tocharians, foreigners yet Persians deep-down, have established a curious little culture on the boundless plains amidst the leering mountains of Kashgaria. Under watchful snow-capped peaks, Tocharian merchants strive to capitalise upon the ancient Silk Road - the route to the infamous, unseen realm of China in the far east. Perhaps absorbing the Tocharians could bring us new opportunities."
 per_dragon_title:0 "Confront the Dragon"
 per_dragon_desc:0 "With the Silk Road in our grasp, we have come before China - the eternal dragon of the far east, an empire, a civilisation, a world in its own right, so far-removed and insulated that it views all beyond its borders with heavenly scorn, demanding tribute and respect. We are no savages, however. We are no petty peasant tribe to be bullied and vassalized. We are Persians and they will learn this - either the easy way or the hard way."
 per_china_trade_title:0 "Trade with China"
 per_china_trade_desc:0 "Having established ourselves in this strange new world, new opportunities present themselves. The fine and spectacular goods of China, available in tantalising, awesome surplus, lay waiting to be capitalised on. Our merchants yearn to enrich themselves, our sailors eye the marshy coasts greedily and our nobles plot in earnest. Our time to strike is now - China's riches await!"
 per_turkmen_title:0 "Recruit the Turkmen"
 per_turkmen_desc:0 "The steppe's southern extent has been conquered and tamed. Yet our nobles postulate more could be done. If we were to assimilate more tribes to our hegemony, integrate lands of key importance, we could in theory establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. The steppe peoples yearn eternally for war, for glory, for coin - what better way to tame them than to give them what they want?"
 per_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 per_georgia_desc:0 "Georgia has been a point of contention for our ancestors. Over the long centuries, Georgia, Armenia and the mountains of the Caucasus have been a place of struggle, where Roman, Persian and mercenary blood alike have been shed, drying in the old and wizened mountain valleys. Now, no vast, treacherous empire waits to challenge us - the region is ours for the picking, ours to dominate, ours to claim."
 per_seljuks_title:0 "Chasten the Seljuks"
 per_seljuks_desc:0 "The Seljuk Turks once shredded through Persia. Like the foul marauders they are, they wandered west, burning and desecrating all in sight until choosing to settle in the east of Anatolia. Their current rulers, their current peasantry, their current nobles, may have all forgotten their history, how their ancestors plundered us - but we have not. In due time, the Turks will be punished for their misdeeds - retribution will come."
 per_march_title:0 "March on Constantinople"
 per_march_desc:0 "Across the glimmering waters of the Bosporus sits a city eternal - the city of Constantinople, founded and pioneered by its namesake simply to situate the Roman power structure closer to our borders, to keep us at bay. Countless hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of our ancestors, bled in the once-endless struggle against Roman tyranny. To capture Constantinople, to subjugate Thrace, to advance upon the wretched coastlines of Greece, would be to restore our honour and avenge our ancestors." 
 per_avenge_title:0 "Avenge Nineveh"
 per_avenge_desc:0 "A thousand years have passed since a humiliation so brutal that it stains our history. The bastard Roman Heraclius shattered our armies at the ancient Assyrian site of Nineveh, sending the Sassanian realm into such catastrophic disarray that the Muslims dared attempt to brutalise our people and way of life in a struggle that lasted centuries. Now, we have returned - Nineveh and the Bosporus alike are ours. Constantinople, one of the beating hearts of Roman identity, awaits. Let us have our revenge."
 per_levantine_title:0 "Levantine Incursion"
 per_levantine_desc:0 "Before the Muslims, before the Christians, before Alexander, the Levant was a wing of our empire. Zoroaster's word stretched from Gaza to Ghor - simpler, better times, which were robbed from us by heathens, barbarians and treacherous ravagers. With the Levant tantalisingly close, our generals, our armies, yearn to reclaim what was once ours - and just one triumph could empower our military's morale to blazing heights unseen."
 per_jerusalem_title:0 "Destroy Jerusalem"
 per_jerusalem_desc:0 "Muslims, Christians and Jews alike squabble over an insignificant city nestled beside the Dead Sea. With so many lives lost to a damnable wall, a bemusing hill and the coveted remains of a cross with so many fabled pieces that one could fashion a fleet from it, it'd probably be best if the city were just... done away with. Perhaps if we simply... looked aside while a most unruly general and his fighting force ripped the city to shreds, burning thousands of years of history to the ground..."
 per_agiptus_title:0 "Reclaim Agiptus"
 per_agiptus_desc:0 "Egypt was a jewel of our empire. It is an ancient granary, a heartland of North Africa, the western extent of old Persia. Robbed from us over a thousand years ago by the wily Alexander and his rabble of Macedonian curs, Egypt has since been torn apart - going from Greek, to Roman, to Arabic hands in the blink of an eye. We have no doubt that the Arabic Egyptians, unfamiliar as they are to the Persian ways, would gladly welcome our stability and tolerance."
 per_arabia_title:0 "Burn the Black Banner"
 per_arabia_desc:0 "Through the rugged mountains south of the Levant, one can find the Kaaba - the heart of the Muslim faith, the source of a great ill which has threatened the very existence of Zoroaster's faithful. Much like Jerusalem, the fabled beating heart of Islam could be conquered and subsequently desecrated. A death blow to be announced to the Muslim world as the contents of their black box spill across a plaza reduced to ashes - retribution divine and holy, announced to the world."
 per_persianize_title:0 "Persianize the Turks"
 per_persianize_desc:0 "Anatolia is ours and with it, a sizable population of Turks. Their tenacity and wealth of manpower cannot be denied - they would make a fine addition to the empire, should they be educated and civilised. If we were to rid them of the various accumulated traditions and tongues clinging to them, we could assimilate the Turks beneath our cultural banner - make them Iranians, well and true, for centuries to come."
 per_terminus_title:0 "Terminus of the Silk Road"
 per_terminus_desc:0 "Egypt is in our grasp and our empire greets the Mediterranean with open arms, welcoming its riches and eager merchants as if they were old friends.

 per_maragheh_title:0 "The Maragheh Observatory"
 per_maragheh_desc:0 "Centuries ago, an observatory was constructed by the Ilkhanids just shy of the city of Maragheh. To their credit, many notable astronomers and scientists flocked to the site, pioneering strange new inventions and astronomical observations. Sadly, lack of patronage and neglect have reduced the observatory to a depleted husk. To celebrate our reclamation and restoration of Persia, we should restore the observatory!"
 per_mesopotamia_title:0 "The Fertile Crescent"
 per_mesopotamia_desc:0 "To our west, crowding the Tigris and the Euphrates, sits a world abused, in tatters and bereft of autonomy - a world where civilisation once blossomed and stood tall. At our height, we cradled the Fertile Crescent, bestowed upon it the respect it deserved. Now, we must do so again - drive out the barbarians which dare despoil it!"
 per_ctesiphon_title:0 "Rebuild Ctesiphon"
 per_ctesiphon_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Ctesiphon stood as a ceremonious capital of Persia. Known as a place where several cities crowded, met and eventually merged, Ctesiphon was a vital geopolitical crossroad and some say one of the largest cities in the world. After the Muslim conquest however, the city fell into disarray. With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make of its ruins a city far grander, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
 per_nahrawan_title:0 "Improve the Nahrawan"

Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."
 per_kushan_title:0 "Kushanshah"
 per_kushan_desc:0 "South of our Tocharian holdings, one gazes upon Kashmir - a beautiful boundary between the Hindu world and the heavenly peaks of the Himalayas. Countless riches, sprawling histories and ruins aplenty line the region's many forested valleys. By virtue of proximity, we deserve to reign over its totality." 
 per_indus_title:0 "Descend into Indus Valley"
 per_indus_desc:0 "The Indus Valley is a peculiar place - a crossroads where cultures clash, where empires have risen and fell and where ancients once forged the first empires. Today, it is a sprawling place, a ripe cornerstone of India, a gateway akin to Kashmir... and a gateway we will smash ajar and exploit. By conquering the Indus Valley, we may not only gain another vantage point, but also sever and drain an artery of Indian manpower and supplies."
 per_windia_title:0 "Control West India"
 per_windia_desc:0 "India bleeds. Its petty rulers, disunited and sprawling, cower in fear. If we were to utterly dominate the region's western extent, we could establish a trade monopoly that could not only starve out our remaining enemies, but announce to India and the world at large who the region's true master is."
 per_gangetic_title:0 "Claim Gangetic Plain"
 per_gangetic_desc:0 "Kashmir has been absorbed into our empire. As a result, the northern reach of India, known as the Gangetic Plain, sits before us. Over the long centuries, many a conqueror has descended upon the plain, exploiting its unfortunate geography so that he might lay claim to India's totality. We shall do the same - bringing India to heel."
 per_bengal_title:0 "Conquer Bengal"
 per_bengal_desc:0 "India's east is dominated by thick, riveting rainforests. Fearsome beasts, mortifying disease and horrors beyond imagination lurk the blackened jungles - yet the inhabitants have made for themselves a civilisation unique and bountiful, taming a vast, intricate ecosystem to sustain themselves. Let us cash in on it and exploit the region's tantalising trade!"
 per_hindustan_title:0 "Empire of Hindustan"
 per_hindustan_desc:0 "India sits at our feet - subjugated, kneeling, grateful. Its thousands of peoples speak in their many tongues of our grace, of the teachings of Zoroaster, of the prosperity brought by Persia's tolerance and acceptance. We will no doubt make short work of the rest of the region - and in no time at all, the world will know us as the true masters of India, as the empire that rules over Hindustan."
 per_spice_title:0 "Reach the Spice Islands"
 per_spice_desc:0 "Beyond China, beyond India, beyond the sparkling seas known by our ancestors, their neighbours, their rivals and their sailing merchants, lay treasures beyond comprehension. What kind of treasure? Spice. The spices of a thousand glimmering plants lay in wait, said to inflame the tongue, enrich the senses and make one's belly bubble with ravenous hunger. Merchants the world over covet these culinary marvels and if we were to dominate the source, we could dominate the world... or at least its kitchens."
 per_integrate_title:0 "Integrate the Hindus"
 per_integrate_desc:0 "The population of a golden subcontinent such as India shall be regarded not as just another one of our subject nations, but as adequate partners to our great civilization - unfortunately, only once we've they are fully subjugated that we can begin integrating them into our society as equals."
 per_architecture_title:0 "Indo-Iranian Architecture"
 per_architecture_desc:0 "It would truly be a pity not to bring our newly integrated lands to their fullest potential. When our enlightened regime is finished there, India will be sprawling with, however large, a sea of fully operative and efficient cities in our civilization's name."

 per_aden_title:0 "The Gate of Lamentation"
 per_aden_desc:0 "Across the vast sands lies Bab-el-Mandeb, or the Gate of Lamentation, our king among kings cannot afford to be deprived of such a prized possession. The weak-minded and greedy princes of Arabia Felix and Abyssinia shall certainly concede or be blown to bits at our navy's doing."
 per_african_bases_title:0 "East African Bases"
 per_african_bases_desc:0 "Taking a page out of our southern neighbourhood, many important statesmen insist it is now time to make the Indian Ocean a Persian Ocean; the perfect lands to begin this process are off the Swahili coast, viewed as succulent prey by our generals and merchants alike. To glory!"
 per_south_africa_title:0 "Claim the Cape"
 per_south_africa_desc:0 "On our recent endeavours to circumnavigate Africa, we believe to have encountered its southernmost point. While they may just be sandy reefs now, the explorers who witnessed them foresaw within them the potential to become an international trading hub; were we to take it over now, every empire in the world would have to pay a toll to us in order to pass through it."
 per_unknown_title:0 "Into the Unknown"
 per_unknown_desc:0 "The Ocean is vast and unpredictable; it was our duty to chart it, it is our chance to settle it and our hope is to control it entirely. As our settlers march into the less fortunate regions of Africa, we wonder not whether these savages know of our might, for we shall make sure they - all of them, from Ireland to Cathay - remember the glory of the Persian Empire."
 per_fortify_hormuz_title:0 "Fortify Hormuz"
 per_fortify_hormuz_desc:0 "The island of Hormuz, named after our ancestral deity Ahura Mazda, serves as the gateway from our gulf to the Ocean outside. Given how crucial it is to control it, it's just as pivotal that we have a way to defend it in times of great need."
 per_maintain_title:0 "Maintain the Defensive Lines"
 per_maintain_desc:0 "The Persian highlands may seem like a great natural defence, but too many times have our ancestors made the mistake of leaving them unguarded. If we wish for this empire to last, we must double the defences nature kindly gave us."
 per_never_title:0 "Never Again"
 per_never_desc:0 "Not a soul in the Old World forgot the Greco-Persian wars, Alexander's conquests, the fall of Sasan's children and the humiliations imparted upon us by the treacherous nomads from the East. Many believe our empire is weak, and Persia a mere geographical expression. We shall show the world that the time of defeat and instability is in the past, for the future will be Persian."
 per_eternal_flame_title:0 "Rekindle the Eternal Flame"

 per_gondeshapur_desc:0 "The Academy of Gondishapur was one of the three Sasanian centres of education, next to the likes of Ras-al Ayn and fair Ctesiphon, as well as the most important centre of medicine in the ancient world.

 per_persian_renaissance_desc:0 "Across the world, the city-states of Italy have had the bright idea of returning to their ancient glory, when still their head Rome made a worthy rival.

Cataphracts struck fear in the hearts of our rivals of old, shattering Roman legions and rebel rabble alike with impunity. So successful were they that the remnant Romans of later ages adopted our tactics, seeking to copy us - admittedly, to great effect. Let us revive this monster of the battlefield!"

Intelligence, boldness, power and determination - our armies are known for these traits, led now by generals with decades of experience, fashioned into hordes of fearsome Cataphracts and brutal infantry. With this restored might, it is only fitting that we restore yet another pillar of our fallen legacy - the dreaded war elephant. The bones of our enemies shall be pounded to dust beneath their might!"

Recalled by ancient Persian and Roman scholars alike, the Immortals were fierce heavy infantry of great standing, numbering 10,000 at any given time, no more, no less. In service, they guarded not only our ruler, but the empire as a whole. With our military might and burgeoning empire, it seems right that we revive this legend and make our enemies cower!"

 mper_consolidate_title:0 "Consolidate the Realm"
 mper_consolidate_desc:0 "Persia has fallen beneath our banner. Its totality sits within our grasp - every valley gouged into the ancient earth, every arid desert settlement sitting eternally on the outskirts of civilised life, they all fall under our influence - yet they do not kneel.

Once in a blue moon, wise and humble peoples come forth from the maws of history to provide us with splendid company, but this cannot be counted upon. The steppe is dangerous and so are its inhabitants. We'd best bring the fight to them and subjugate their energies, lest they bring the fight to us."
 mper_silk_title:0 "Follow the Silk Road"

Under watchful snow-capped peaks, Tocharian merchants strive to capitalise upon the ancient Silk Road - the route to the infamous, unseen realm of China in the far east. Perhaps absorbing the Tocharians could bring us new opportunities."
 mper_dragon_title:0 "Confront the Dragon"
 mper_dragon_desc:0 "With the Silk Road in our grasp, we have come before China - the eternal dragon of the far east, an empire, a civilisation, a world in its own right, so far-removed and insulated that it views all beyond its borders with heavenly scorn, demanding tribute and respect. We are no savages, however. We are no petty peasant tribe to be bullied and vassalized. We are Persians and they will learn this - either the easy way or the hard way."

 mper_turkmen_title:0 "Recruit the Turkmen"
 mper_turkmen_desc:0 "The steppe's southern extent has been conquered and tamed. Yet our nobles postulate more could be done. If we were to assimilate more tribes to our hegemony, integrate lands of key importance, we could in theory establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. The steppe peoples yearn eternally for war, for glory, for coin - what better way to tame them than to give them what they want?"
 mper_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 mper_georgia_desc:0 "Georgia has been a point of contention for our ancestors. Over the long centuries, Georgia, Armenia and the mountains of the Caucasus have been a place of struggle, where Roman, Persian and mercenary blood alike have been shed, drying in the old and wizened mountain valleys. Now, no vast, treacherous empire waits to challenge us - the region is ours for the picking, ours to dominate, ours to claim."
 mper_seljuks_title:0 "Chasten the Seljuks"
 mper_seljuks_desc:0 "The Seljuk Turks once shredded through Persia. Like the foul marauders they are, they wandered west, burning and desecrating all in sight until choosing to settle in the east of Anatolia. Their current rulers, their current peasantry, their current nobles, may have all forgotten their history, how their ancestors plundered us - but we have not. In due time, the Turks will be punished for their misdeeds - retribution will come."
 mper_march_title:0 "March on Constantinople"
 mper_march_desc:0 "Across the glimmering waters of the Bosporus sits a city eternal - the city of Constantinople, founded and pioneered by its namesake simply to situate the Roman power structure closer to our borders, to keep us at bay. Countless hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of our ancestors, bled in the once-endless struggle against Roman tyranny. To capture Constantinople, to subjugate Thrace, to advance upon the wretched coastlines of Greece, would be to restore our honour and avenge our ancestors." 
 mper_avenge_title:0 "Avenge Nineveh"
 mper_avenge_desc:0 "A thousand years have passed since a humiliation so brutal that it stains our history. The bastard Roman Heraclius shattered our armies at the ancient Assyrian site of Nineveh, sending the Sassanian realm into such catastrophic disarray that the Muslims dared attempt to brutalise our people and way of life in a struggle that lasted centuries. Now, we have returned - Nineveh and the Bosporus alike are ours. Constantinople, one of the beating hearts of Roman identity, awaits. Let us have our revenge."
 mper_levantine_title:0 "Levantine Incursion"
 mper_levantine_desc:0 "Before the Muslims, before the Christians, before Alexander, the Levant was a wing of our empire. Zoroaster's word stretched from Gaza to Ghor - simpler, better times, which were robbed from us by heathens, barbarians and treacherous ravagers. With the Levant tantalisingly close, our generals, our armies, yearn to reclaim what was once ours - and just one triumph could empower our military's morale to blazing heights unseen."
 mper_jerusalem_title:0 "Destroy Jerusalem"
 mper_jerusalem_desc:0 "Muslims, Christians and Jews alike squabble over an insignificant city nestled beside the Dead Sea. With so many lives lost to a damnable wall, a bemusing hill and the coveted remains of a cross with so many fabled pieces that one could fashion a fleet from it, it'd probably be best if the city were just... done away with. Perhaps if we simply... looked aside while a most unruly general and his fighting force ripped the city to shreds, burning thousands of years of history to the ground..."
 mper_agiptus_title:0 "Reclaim Agiptus"
 mper_agiptus_desc:0 "Egypt was a jewel of our empire. It is an ancient granary, a heartland of North Africa, the western extent of old Persia. Robbed from us over a thousand years ago by the wily Alexander and his rabble of Macedonian curs, Egypt has since been torn apart - going from Greek, to Roman, to Arabic hands in the blink of an eye. We have no doubt that the Arabic Egyptians, unfamiliar as they are to the Persian ways, would gladly welcome our stability and tolerance."
 mper_arabia_title:0 "Burn the Black Banner"
 mper_arabia_desc:0 "Through the rugged mountains south of the Levant, one can find the Kaaba - the heart of the Muslim faith, the source of a great ill which has threatened the very existence of Zoroaster's faithful. Much like Jerusalem, the fabled beating heart of Islam could be conquered and subsequently desecrated. A death blow to be announced to the Muslim world as the contents of their black box spill across a plaza reduced to ashes - retribution divine and holy, announced to the world."
 mper_persianize_title:0 "Persianize the Turks"
 mper_persianize_desc:0 "Anatolia is ours and with it, a sizable population of Turks. Their tenacity and wealth of manpower cannot be denied - they would make a fine addition to the empire, should they be educated and civilised. If we were to rid them of the various accumulated traditions and tongues clinging to them, we could assimilate the Turks beneath our cultural banner - make them Iranians, well and true, for centuries to come."
 mper_terminus_title:0 "Terminus of the Silk Road"
 mper_terminus_desc:0 "Egypt is in our grasp and our empire greets the Mediterranean with open arms, welcoming its riches and eager merchants as if they were old friends. This has not come without issue, however - greedy Europeans have leapt at the chance to exploit the turmoil, slipping into a kind of economic power vacuum to garner as much wealth as possible. We must have none of it - Aleppo and Alexandria bow to US, it is OUR coin which reigns here! Only through Persia can the lifeblood of the Silk Road be ferried!"
 mper_maragheh_title:0 "The Maragheh Observatory"
 mper_maragheh_desc:0 "Centuries ago, an observatory was constructed by the Ilkhanids just shy of the city of Maragheh. To their credit, many notable astronomers and scientists flocked to the site, pioneering strange new inventions and astronomical observations. Sadly, lack of patronage and neglect have reduced the observatory to a depleted husk. To celebrate our reclamation and restoration of Persia, we should restore the observatory!"
 mper_mesopotamia_title:0 "The Fertile Crescent"
 mper_mesopotamia_desc:0 "To our west, crowding the Tigris and the Euphrates, sits a world abused, in tatters and bereft of autonomy - a world where civilisation once blossomed and stood tall. At our height, we cradled the Fertile Crescent, bestowed upon it the respect it deserved. Now, we must do so again - drive out the barbarians which dare despoil it!"
 mper_ctesiphon_title:0 "Rebuild Ctesiphon"
 mper_ctesiphon_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Ctesiphon stood as a ceremonious capital of Persia. Known as a place where several cities crowded, met and eventually merged, Ctesiphon was a vital geopolitical crossroad and some say one of the largest cities in the world. After the Muslim conquest however, the city fell into disarray. With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make of its ruins a city far grander, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
 mper_nahrawan_title:0 "Improve the Nahrawan"
 mper_nahrawan_desc:0 "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."
 mper_kushan_title:0 "Kushanshah"
 mper_kushan_desc:0 "South of our Tocharian holdings, one gazes upon Kashmir - a beautiful boundary between the Hindu world and the heavenly peaks of the Himalayas.

 mper_indus_title:0 "Descend into Indus Valley"
 mper_indus_desc:0 "The Indus Valley is a peculiar place - a crossroads where cultures clash, where empires have risen and fell and where ancients once forged the first empires. Today, it is a sprawling place, a ripe cornerstone of India, a gateway akin to Kashmir... and a gateway we will smash ajar and exploit. By conquering the Indus Valley, we may not only gain another vantage point, but also sever and drain an artery of Indian manpower and supplies."
 mper_windia_title:0 "Control West India"
 mper_windia_desc:0 "India bleeds. Its petty rulers, disunited and sprawling, cower in fear. If we were to utterly dominate the region's western extent, we could establish a trade monopoly that could not only starve out our remaining enemies, but announce to India and the world at large who the region's true master is."
 mper_gangetic_title:0 "Claim Gangetic Plain"
 mper_gangetic_desc:0 "Kashmir has been absorbed into our empire. As a result, the northern reach of India, known as the Gangetic Plain, sits before us. Over the long centuries, many a conqueror has descended upon the plain, exploiting its unfortunate geography so that he might lay claim to India's totality. We shall do the same - bringing India to heel."
 mper_bengal_title:0 "Conquer Bengal"
 mper_bengal_desc:0 "India's east is dominated by thick, riveting rainforests. Fearsome beasts, mortifying disease and horrors beyond imagination lurk the blackened jungles - yet the inhabitants have made for themselves a civilisation unique and bountiful, taming a vast, intricate ecosystem to sustain themselves. Let us cash in on it and exploit the region's tantalising trade!"
 mper_hindustan_title:0 "Empire of Hindustan"
 mper_hindustan_desc:0 "India sits at our feet - subjugated, kneeling, grateful. Its thousands of peoples speak in their many tongues of our grace, of the teachings of Mani, of the prosperity brought by Persia's tolerance and acceptance. We will no doubt make short work of the rest of the region - and in no time at all, the world will know us as the true masters of India, as the empire that rules over Hindustan."
 mper_spice_title:0 "Reach the Spice Islands"
 mper_spice_desc:0 "Beyond China, beyond India, beyond the sparkling seas known by our ancestors, their neighbours, their rivals and their sailing merchants, lay treasures beyond comprehension. What kind of treasure? Spice. The spices of a thousand glimmering plants lay in wait, said to inflame the tongue, enrich the senses and make one's belly bubble with ravenous hunger. Merchants the world over covet these culinary marvels and if we were to dominate the source, we could dominate the world... or at least its kitchens."
 mper_integrate_title:0 "Integrate the Hindus"
 mper_integrate_desc:0 "The population of a golden subcontinent such as India shall be regarded not as just another one of our subject nations, but as adequate partners to our great civilization - unfortunately, only once we've they are fully subjugated that we can begin integrating them into our society as equals."

Countless hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of our ancestors, bled in the once-endless struggle against Roman tyranny. To capture Constantinople, to subjugate Thrace, to advance upon the wretched coastlines of Greece, would be to restore our honour and avenge our ancestors."

The bastard Roman Heraclius shattered our armies at the ancient Assyrian site of Nineveh, sending the Sassanian realm into such catastrophic disarray that the Muslims dared attempt to brutalise our people and way of life in a struggle that lasted centuries.

 perc_ctesiphon_title:0 "Rebuild Ctesiphon"
 perc_ctesiphon_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Ctesiphon stood as a ceremonious capital of Persia. Known as a place where several cities crowded, met and eventually merged, Ctesiphon was a vital geopolitical crossroad and some say one of the largest cities in the world. After the Muslim conquest however, the city fell into disarray. With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make of its ruins a city far grander, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
 perc_nahrawan_title:0 "Improve the Nahrawan"
 perc_nahrawan_desc:0 "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."

 perm_gerrha_desc:0 "To the south of Meshan is Gerrha - a vital Arabian coastline, rife with fierce commercial competition. For centuries, the Khaleeji of Arabia have competed valiantly with our native merchants - but no more, we say. With our resurgent strength, we may conquer and assimilate this region, making it a vital addition to our blossoming trade empire."
 perm_mazun_title:0 "Conquer Mazun"
 perm_mazun_desc:0 "A symbolic victory is in sight. Mazun, heartland of the Khaleeji, the Hormuzi merchants our empire tirelessly competes against, sits at our feet. Helpless and petty, they may fall to our efforts - and with the tip of Arabia in our grasp, a monopoly, a domination outright of the Indian Ocean, could be within our grasp, securing our place in the world as a naval hegemon to be feared."
 perm_consolidate_title:0 "Consolidate the Realm"
 perm_consolidate_desc:0 "Persia has fallen beneath our banner. Its totality sits within our grasp - every valley gouged into the ancient earth, every arid desert settlement sitting eternally on the outskirts of civilised life, they all fall under our influence - yet they do not kneel. Separatist sentiment, radicalised peasantry and rampant disorganisation must be quelled. Our subjects must learn their place!" 
 perm_seat_title:0 "Seat of the Shahanshah"
 perm_seat_desc:0 "Persia bows before us, yet our capital does not stand as high as it should. From the hot sands of Cairo to the distant silk-laden east, it is known that marvellous, empowering capitals spring up where rightful, legitimate kings reign. We must waste no more time - our Shahanshah deserves a proper capital!"
 perm_tribes_title:0 "Subjugate the Tribes"
 perm_tribes_desc:0 "To the north, chaos reigns. Since time immemorial, fiendish savages have reigned over the steppe. Once in a blue moon, wise and humble peoples come forth from the maws of history to provide us with splendid company, but this cannot be counted upon. The steppe is dangerous and so are its inhabitants. We'd best bring the fight to them and subjugate their energies, lest they bring the fight to us."
 perm_silk_title:0 "Follow the Silk Road"
 perm_silk_desc:0 "To the east, the intrepid Tocharians, foreigners yet Persians deep-down, have established a curious little culture on the boundless plains amidst the leering mountains of Kashgaria. Under watchful snow-capped peaks, Tocharian merchants strive to capitalise upon the ancient Silk Road - the route to the infamous, unseen realm of China in the far east. Perhaps absorbing the Tocharians could bring us new opportunities."
 perm_dragon_title:0 "Confront the Dragon"
 perm_dragon_desc:0 "With the Silk Road in our grasp, we have come before China - the eternal dragon of the far east, an empire, a civilisation, a world in its own right, so far-removed and insulated that it views all beyond its borders with heavenly scorn, demanding tribute and respect. We are no savages, however. We are no petty peasant tribe to be bullied and vassalized. We are Persians and they will learn this - either the easy way or the hard way."
 perm_china_trade_title:0 "Trade with China"
 perm_china_trade_desc:0 "Having established ourselves in this strange new world, new opportunities present themselves. The fine and spectacular goods of China, available in tantalising, awesome surplus, lay waiting to be capitalised on. Our merchants yearn to enrich themselves, our sailors eye the marshy coasts greedily and our nobles plot in earnest. Our time to strike is now - China's riches await!"
 perm_turkmen_title:0 "Recruit the Turkmen"
 perm_turkmen_desc:0 "The steppe's southern extent has been conquered and tamed. Yet our nobles postulate more could be done. If we were to assimilate more tribes to our hegemony, integrate lands of key importance, we could in theory establish a monopoly on Turkic manpower. The steppe peoples yearn eternally for war, for glory, for coin - what better way to tame them than to give them what they want?"
 perm_georgia_title:0 "Devastate Georgia"
 perm_georgia_desc:0 "Georgia has been a point of contention for our ancestors. Over the long centuries, Georgia, Armenia and the mountains of the Caucasus have been a place of struggle, where Roman, Persian and mercenary blood alike have been shed, drying in the old and wizened mountain valleys. Now, no vast, treacherous empire waits to challenge us - the region is ours for the picking, ours to dominate, ours to claim."
 perm_seljuks_title:0 "Chasten the Seljuks"
 perm_seljuks_desc:0 "The Seljuk Turks once shredded through Persia. Like the foul marauders they are, they wandered west, burning and desecrating all in sight until choosing to settle in the east of Anatolia. Their current rulers, their current peasantry, their current nobles, may have all forgotten their history, how their ancestors plundered us - but we have not. In due time, the Turks will be punished for their misdeeds - retribution will come."
 perm_march_title:0 "March on Constantinople"
 perm_march_desc:0 "Across the glimmering waters of the Bosporus sits a city eternal - the city of Constantinople, founded and pioneered by its namesake simply to situate the Roman power structure closer to our borders, to keep us at bay. Countless hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of our ancestors, bled in the once-endless struggle against Roman tyranny. To capture Constantinople, to subjugate Thrace, to advance upon the wretched coastlines of Greece, would be to restore our honour and avenge our ancestors." 
 perm_avenge_title:0 "Avenge Nineveh"
 perm_avenge_desc:0 "A thousand years have passed since a humiliation so brutal that it stains our history. The bastard Roman Heraclius shattered our armies at the ancient Assyrian site of Nineveh, sending the Sassanian realm into such catastrophic disarray that the Muslims dared attempt to brutalise our people and way of life in a struggle that lasted centuries. Now, we have returned - Nineveh and the Bosporus alike are ours. Constantinople, one of the beating hearts of Roman identity, awaits. Let us have our revenge."
 perm_levantine_title:0 "Levantine Incursion"
 perm_levantine_desc:0 "Before the Muslims, before the Christians, before Alexander, the Levant was a wing of our empire. Zoroaster's word stretched from Gaza to Ghor - simpler, better times, which were robbed from us by heathens, barbarians and treacherous ravagers. With the Levant tantalisingly close, our generals, our armies, yearn to reclaim what was once ours - and just one triumph could empower our military's morale to blazing heights unseen."
 perm_agiptus_title:0 "Reclaim Agiptus"
 perm_agiptus_desc:0 "Egypt was a jewel of our empire. It is an ancient granary, a heartland of North Africa, the western extent of old Persia. Robbed from us over a thousand years ago by the wily Alexander and his rabble of Macedonian curs, Egypt has since been torn apart - going from Greek, to Roman, to Arabic hands in the blink of an eye. We have no doubt that the Arabic Egyptians, unfamiliar as they are to the Persian ways, would gladly welcome our stability and tolerance."
 perm_persianize_title:0 "Persianize the Turks"
 perm_persianize_desc:0 "Anatolia is ours and with it, a sizable population of Turks. Their tenacity and wealth of manpower cannot be denied - they would make a fine addition to the empire, should they be educated and civilised. If we were to rid them of the various accumulated traditions and tongues clinging to them, we could assimilate the Turks beneath our cultural banner - make them Iranians, well and true, for centuries to come."
 perm_terminus_title:0 "Terminus of the Silk Road"
 perm_terminus_desc:0 "Egypt is in our grasp and our empire greets the Mediterranean with open arms, welcoming its riches and eager merchants as if they were old friends. This has not come without issue, however - greedy Europeans have leapt at the chance to exploit the turmoil, slipping into a kind of economic power vacuum to garner as much wealth as possible. We must have none of it - Aleppo and Alexandria bow to US, it is OUR coin which reigns here! Only through Persia can the lifeblood of the Silk Road be ferried!"
 perm_maragheh_title:0 "The Maragheh Observatory"
 perm_maragheh_desc:0 "Centuries ago, an observatory was constructed by the Ilkhanids just shy of the city of Maragheh. To their credit, many notable astronomers and scientists flocked to the site, pioneering strange new inventions and astronomical observations. Sadly, lack of patronage and neglect have reduced the observatory to a depleted husk. To celebrate our reclamation and restoration of Persia, we should restore the observatory!"
 perm_mesopotamia_title:0 "The Fertile Crescent"
 perm_mesopotamia_desc:0 "To our west, crowding the Tigris and the Euphrates, sits a world abused, in tatters and bereft of autonomy - a world where civilisation once blossomed and stood tall. At our height, we cradled the Fertile Crescent, bestowed upon it the respect it deserved. Now, we must do so again - drive out the barbarians which dare despoil it!"
 perm_ctesiphon_title:0 "Rebuild Ctesiphon"
 perm_ctesiphon_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Ctesiphon stood as a ceremonious capital of Persia. Known as a place where several cities crowded, met and eventually merged, Ctesiphon was a vital geopolitical crossroad and some say one of the largest cities in the world. After the Muslim conquest however, the city fell into disarray. With vengeance on the menu, our advisors suggest we make of its ruins a city far grander, far more magnificent, far more wealthy than any seen before - a new Ctesiphon, a shining Ctesiphon!"
 perm_nahrawan_title:0 "Improve the Nahrawan"
 perm_nahrawan_desc:0 "During the times of Parthia, great works were undertaken along the Tigris and Euphrates to ensure water flowed where it was needed. Mesopotamia was fed by its convoluted, sprawling system of veins - farmers and peasants alike depending on the flow of its waters for sustenance and prosperity. Barbaric infighting and countless wars have seen the canals abused and razed however. Now that we are back in charge, it is our divine duty to see these great works restored and Mesopotamia prosper."
 perm_kushan_title:0 "Kushanshah"
 perm_kushan_desc:0 "South of our Tocharian holdings, one gazes upon Kashmir - a beautiful boundary between the Hindu world and the heavenly peaks of the Himalayas. Countless riches, sprawling histories and ruins aplenty line the region's many forested valleys. By virtue of proximity, we deserve to reign over its totality." 
 perm_indus_title:0 "Descend into Indus Valley"
 perm_indus_desc:0 "The Indus Valley is a peculiar place - a crossroads where cultures clash, where empires have risen and fell and where ancients once forged the first empires. Today, it is a sprawling place, a ripe cornerstone of India, a gateway akin to Kashmir... and a gateway we will smash ajar and exploit. By conquering the Indus Valley, we may not only gain another vantage point, but also sever and drain an artery of Indian manpower and supplies."
 perm_windia_title:0 "Control West India"
 perm_windia_desc:0 "India bleeds. Its petty rulers, disunited and sprawling, cower in fear. If we were to utterly dominate the region's western extent, we could establish a trade monopoly that could not only starve out our remaining enemies, but announce to India and the world at large who the region's true master is."
 perm_gangetic_title:0 "Claim Gangetic Plain"
 perm_gangetic_desc:0 "Kashmir has been absorbed into our empire. As a result, the northern reach of India, known as the Gangetic Plain, sits before us. Over the long centuries, many a conqueror has descended upon the plain, exploiting its unfortunate geography so that he might lay claim to India's totality. We shall do the same - bringing India to heel."
 perm_bengal_title:0 "Conquer Bengal"
 perm_bengal_desc:0 "India's east is dominated by thick, riveting rainforests. Fearsome beasts, mortifying disease and horrors beyond imagination lurk the blackened jungles - yet the inhabitants have made for themselves a civilisation unique and bountiful, taming a vast, intricate ecosystem to sustain themselves. Let us cash in on it and exploit the region's tantalising trade!"
 perm_hindustan_title:0 "Empire of Hindustan"
 perm_hindustan_desc:0 "India sits at our feet - subjugated, kneeling, grateful. Its thousands of peoples speak in their many tongues of our grace, of the teachings of Muhammad, of the prosperity brought by Persia's tolerance and acceptance. We will no doubt make short work of the rest of the region - and in no time at all, the world will know us as the true masters of India, as the empire that rules over Hindustan."
 perm_spice_title:0 "Reach the Spice Islands"
 perm_spice_desc:0 "Beyond China, beyond India, beyond the sparkling seas known by our ancestors, their neighbours, their rivals and their sailing merchants, lay treasures beyond comprehension. What kind of treasure? Spice. The spices of a thousand glimmering plants lay in wait, said to inflame the tongue, enrich the senses and make one's belly bubble with ravenous hunger. Merchants the world over covet these culinary marvels and if we were to dominate the source, we could dominate the world... or at least its kitchens."

 perm_south_africa_desc:0 "On our recent endeavours to circumnavigate Africa, we believe to have encountered its southernmost point.

 grg_cataphracts_title:0 "Adopt the Cataphracts"
 grg_cataphracts_desc:0 "The Cataphracts - mounted warriors and hoofed beasts plated all over in the finest metal armour - were a staple of old Persia. Cataphracts struck fear in the hearts of our rivals of old, shattering Roman legions and rebel rabble alike with impunity. So successful were they that the remnant Romans of later ages adopted our tactics, seeking to copy us - admittedly, to great effect. Let us revive this monster of the battlefield!"
 grg_elephants_title:0 "Reintroduce War Elephants"
 grg_elephants_desc:0 "Our army's efficacy has reached new heights. Intelligence, boldness, power and determination - our armies are known for these traits, led now by generals with decades of experience, fashioned into hordes of fearsome Cataphracts and brutal infantry. With this restored might, it is only fitting that we restore yet another pillar of our fallen legacy - the dreaded war elephant. The bones of our enemies shall be pounded to dust beneath their might!"
 grg_immortals_title:0 "Revive the Immortals"
 grg_immortals_desc:0 "Our proud history has been muddied and diluted over time. Legends stand out however - paramount among them, that of the Immortals. Recalled by ancient Persian and Roman scholars alike, the Immortals were fierce heavy infantry of great standing, numbering 10,000 at any given time, no more, no less. In service, they guarded not only our ruler, but the empire as a whole. With our military might and burgeoning empire, it seems right that we revive this legend and make our enemies cower!"
 grg_great_wall_title:0 "Reinforce the Great Wall"
 grg_great_wall_desc:0 "Our great founder Togha Temur picked his stronghold well, Gurgan has been a fortress since Parthian times, and made impregnable during the Sassanids.

From the hot sands of Cairo to the distant silk-laden east, it is known that marvellous, empowering capitals spring up where rightful, legitimate kings reign. We must waste no more time - our Shahanshah deserves a proper capital!"
 grg_mountain_expansion_title:0 "Mountain Expansion"
 grg_mountain_expansion_desc:0 "The Persian highlands have been undervalued by every dimwit warlord who tried pacifying them - not wasteland, nay, but the jumping point for the greatest cities in the world, closest to Heaven and sprawling across it. It is about time we show our dull neighbours how it's done."
 grg_silk_bazaar_title:0 "Expand the Trade Networks"
 grg_silk_bazaar_desc:0 "With the decline of Mongol power and the breakup of Persia, the wealth of the silk road has dried up considerably. In aeons past, the riches of Asia flowed from and to Persia, and with our patronage that wealth can once again be ours."

 grg_patronize_desc:0 "Our neighbourhood, the Steppes to the north and the sands of Arabia to the south, is known for great conquerors, but not as much for great scientists and patrons. Our leverage lies in the technological advantages our government prides itself on, and we must make use of it."

 mgs_khiva_desc:0 "Khiva is an important outpost to guard our western frontiers and a strategic location to retreat in the unlikely case we are defeated in Persia. It is also a renowned trade post, which would prosper from becoming part of our renovated Yam. That is, so long as we go and take it."

The Zunbils can not fall; we will not let them. Rob will lead the unyielding Zuns into a glorious future, one where all of Persia can bathe in the light!" 
 zun_overpower_title:0 "Overpower the Neighbours" 
 zun_overpower_desc:0 "To state that we are weak would be a major understatement. Compared to our neighbours in the region, we have less troops, less wealth, less land, and less allies. Our first and most important priority is to ensure our survival by conscripting every peasant who can hold a sword into the military. Hopefully that will scare off our greedy neighbours." 
 zun_rebuild_title:0 "Rebuild Ghazni" 
 zun_rebuild_desc:0 "Ghazni was one of the most important cities in all of ancient Persia. It served as a crossroads between the Middle East and India. After years of conquests and sackings, it is nothing more than a small village built around great citadels and ruins. Ghazni must be rebuilt as the centre of our new empire, linking the east and west once again." 
 zun_unite_title:0 "Unite Afghanistan" 
 zun_unite_desc:0 "Afghanistan has not been unified by Afghans for centuries. Foreign invasions and collapse have left little of a united Afghan state. Rob will fix that. All of Afghanistan will soon be praising the Zun as we prove ourselves the new power of Persia." 
 zun_sunset_title:0 "Sunset Over the Empire" 
 zun_sunset_desc:0 "The Persian Empire has been in anarchy ever since the initial Muslim invasion all those years ago; while many have come and attempted to unite such a diverse empire, they have all failed. The Light of Zun will set things right. The once proud and mighty Persian Empire has finally settled under the horizon, but Zun has just begun to rise." 
 zun_persia_title:0 "Invade Persia" 
 zun_persia_desc:0 "With Afghanistan united, our next goal should be the invasion of Persia to our west. While these lands have been devastated many times in recent memory, there is still some wealth left. We cannot afford to let our rivals claim that wealth for themselves. They will taste the wrath of our Burning Crusades!" 
 zun_merv_title:0 "Conquer Merv" 
 zun_merv_desc:0 "The Princedom of Merv is one of the most fortified and impregnable statelets to emerge in the Persian anarchy. Their grand fortress and inhospitable environment means most invading armies die of heat stroke before ever facing their foes. We are different. We are Rob. We do not fear the sun. We embrace it." 
 zun_fortify_title:0 "Repair the Fortifications" 
 zun_fortify_desc:0 "The greatest advantage we have is our natural terrain. Mountains and deserts make invading Afghanistan extremely difficult and frustrating. We should expand upon this and repair ancient fortifications all across the mountains to further frustrate and deter foreign threats." 
 zun_graveyard_title:0 "Graveyard of Empires" 
 zun_graveyard_desc:0 "Afghanistan has been known throughout history as the graveyard of empires. Every empire that has attempted to conquer us quickly fell apart. Our people refuse to yield to foreign threats, and will make sure every invader suffers and waste all their resources attempting to hold us. We will be unconquerable, like our ancestors before us." 
 zun_cloth_title:0 "Expand the Cloth Industry" 
 zun_cloth_desc:0 "One of the most valuable trades in the Indus valley is the cloth trade. Wool has become such a valued commodity that nations as far as Europe seek Indian clothing. We need to control such a profitable trade and expand it to meet the ever growing demand." 
 zun_silk_road_title:0 "Monopolise the Silk Road" 
 zun_silk_road_desc:0 "The Silk Road is ancient, with thousands of years of history and commerce having left major impacts on all stops. Not since the time of the Mongols has one nation truly dominated the Silk Road. Now, we have been presented the opportunity to control the Silk Road. We cannot let this opportunity go." 
 zun_cities_title:0 "Control the Trading Cities" 
 zun_cities_desc:0 "The most important part to maintaining our hegemony over the Silk Road is the control of vital trade cities across it. Without these trade cities, the road will either become unsafe, or be replaced by other routes that are more profitable. This network of trade cities will be expanded upon and turned into the centre of all global trade." 
 zun_industrialize_title:0 "Industrialise the Production" 
 zun_industrialize_desc:0 "Despite how valuable the cloth industry is, it is still costly to produce the cloth in the first place. Fortunately, the power of the sun is now in the palm of our hands, as new techniques allow for production rates to skyrocket. Production shall increase and so shall our profits!" 
 zun_coast_title:0 "Reach the Coast" 
 zun_coast_desc:0 "We spend so much time worshipping the sun in our mountains and deserts that we have not really focused on our navy. Sadly, ships cannot be used to cross the desert, but they can help project power in the surrounding area. In order for the world to fear the mighty Rob, we must first find a way to access the sea. The region of Makran is the perfect place to start." 
 zun_kashmir_title:0 "Control Kashmir" 
 zun_kashmir_desc:0 "The most crucial intersection of cultures and trade occurs in the region of Kashmir. China, India, Persia, and all the near east rely on Kashmir for wealth, with the only other option being the treacherous Indian ocean. The light of Zun shines on all, and it is our destiny to unite all land that Zun blesses." 
 zun_valley_title:0 "Descend into India" 
 zun_valley_desc:0 "Now that we control all that flows in and out of India, the next goal is to begin our invasion. The Indus River was once the border of Macedonia under Alexander, and now it shall become just one piece of our growing Zunist empire." 
 zun_rajputana_title:0 "Unite Rajputana" 
 zun_rajputana_desc:0 "The Rajas of India have been fighting for centuries, and this infighting has weakened them to foreign invasion. Imagine the consequences if one of the Europeans came in and conquered India from them. Fortunately, we are here to save the day. The Rajputs will love to praise the Zun." 
 zun_accommodate_title:0 "Accommodate the Rajputs" 
 zun_accommodate_desc:0 "The Rajputs maintain significant influence despite our conquest. While we could just take care of them the old fashioned way, it would be easier and more beneficial to recruit them into our army. The Rajputs will fight for Zun and spread our light all across India." 
 zun_court_title:0 "Perso-Indian Court" 
 zun_court_desc:0 "Persian ways of thinking and Indian ways of thinking have not always gone hand in hand, but it would be idiotic of us to deny the Indians a seat in our government just because of their race. Indians and Persians will walk together as the united superpowers of the world." 
 zun_gujarat_title:0 "Gujarati Trade Ports" 
 zun_gujarat_desc:0 "The trade ports of Gujarat are the most valuable in the Indian Ocean trade network; though we are already drowning in money, a little more could not hurt. Plus, it would deny our rivals the money as well." 
 zun_north_title:0 "Rein in the North" 
 zun_north_desc:0 "The region of Hindustan has become a hodgepodge of cultures over the past few centuries of Islamic invasions. Our biggest fear could be that one day they will finally unite and throw the world into the shade, blotting out our great Zun. To prevent this, we must crush them first. First the north, then the rest of India." 
 zun_deccan_title:0 "Supremacy over Deccan" 
 zun_deccan_desc:0 "The Tamil kings and other rulers of Deccan maintain trade hegemony between India and the Spice Islands. While we control all trade from Arabia towards the eastern coast, they still profit the most from the elusive spice trade. This will not stand any longer. The last bastions of Hinduism and Buddhism in India will be erased by the light of Zun." 
 zun_bengali_title:0 "Bengali Domination" 
 zun_bengali_desc:0 "One of the most populous places on the planet, the Bengali region could outproduce anywhere with enough investment. Of course our conquest will also spread the light of Zun to these people. So it is a win-win for both our priests, and our merchants." 
 zun_master_title:0 "Master of India" 
 zun_master_desc:0 "We have done it, no foreign power will ever set foot on our own personal subcontinent. We, the Zuns, have conquered the unconquerable. No other nation on Earth has the might, nor the prestige to control it. We are not just some weird cult organised around the sun. We are not some backwards incestuous bastards that can barely adminster a realm. We are the Zuns, we are the masters of India." 
 zun_integrate_title:0 "Integrate the Hindus"
 zun_integrate_desc:0 "Our vast empire now covers much of the Indian subcontinent. If we wish to stabilize our Empire and prevent internal unrest, integrating the Hindu population and treating them as our equals should be our top priority."
 zun_shrines_title:0 "Patronise the Shrines" 
 zun_shrines_desc:0 "Local shrines to Zun dot all across our fledgling empire. Sadly, these shrines are unorganised and lack a cohesive doctrine to preach. Patronising these local shrines and turning them into pilgrimage sites for our faithful will help unify the followers of Zun." 
 zun_wrath_title:0 "Wrath of the Zun" 
 zun_wrath_desc:0 "The world looks upon Zun with pity and hatred. The Zoroastrians think of us as a weird cult, the Muslims view us as disgusting heathens, and the Christians all the same. Yet we stand before them not as equals, but as superiors. They will fear the Wrath of Zun, as our crusaders scorch their countryside with the might of the Zun."

 ghu_suren_desc:0 "The Khorasani Suren dynasty rule over our native people and threaten our southern flank. Unlike the Zunbils, the Surenas actually provide a threat to our state. The levies must be raised and this threat nipped in the bud before it could grow."

 ghu_conquest_desc:0 "To some, the right to rule comes from God, to others, the right to rule comes from the people. But we know better, we know that the right to rule comes from conquest.

 ghu_persia_title:0 "Invade Persia" 
 ghu_persia_desc:0 "With Afghanistan united and our navy finally up and running, we can turn our attention to the lands of Persia. Once a prosperous and fertile region, countless conflicts have turned the mighty empire into a warlord infested arena.

 #Khiva Events
 mnk_flavor.1.t: "A Tribal Leader"
 mnk_flavor.1.d: "The tribes are dissatisfied with the Khan for failing to grasp the opportunities that arise for the benefit of Khiva and for his negligence of the growing concerns of the tribes. His dullness didn't help with the stagnation felt through Chorasmia, as towns struggle to prosper when nomadic raiders threaten every merchant with a pile of gold. This created a rift between the tribal leaders on the issue of leadership. One tribal chief had put forward an idea to overthrow the Khan and replace him with someone the tribes could control and steer in their way. While some argued that a puppet Khan would be even weaker than the current one, instead proposing confrontation as a means for him to take a more active role in leading the Khanate. Whatever path the tribes decide to take will determine the future of Khiva, for better or worse."
 mnk_flavor.1.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s time is up, he must be replaced"
 mnk_flavor.1.b: "He shows great promise. We will not listen to the tribes"
 mnk_flavor.2.t: "An Alliance Request from [From.GetName]"
 mnk_flavor.2.d: "Ever since Genghis Khan's invasion, relations with the Mongols have been tense. Even the successor states of the Mongol Empire, in an effort to achieve past glory, acted in an aggressive manner. Yet, feelings change over time, and coexistence could be made between those who seek it. Today, a messenger from the Golden Horde arrived at our court, which is nothing new as both rulers have been exchanging messages for a while. "My lord, I bear a message from the Great Khan of the Golden Horde: Esteemed Khan of Khiva, may the heavens bless you with good fortune; furthermore, it came to my attention that our realms are cooperating more than ever, and I believe that this diplomatic mission is bearing fruit despite the increasing hostility of neighboring states. For this purpose, I bring forward the proposition to bind this accord with kinship and military alliance." The Khan was surprised, raising his eyebrows as he heard the message. Silence fell throughout the hall for a second as the messenger awaited a reply."
 mnk_flavor.2.a: "This alliance will be of great benefit"
 mnk_flavor.2.b: "They are at the very least our tributary"
 mnk_flavor.3.t: "Fall of Turkestan"
 mnk_flavor.3.d: "Turkestan has always been Chorasmia's rival, as tribes have fought over Transoxiana since antiquity. But now Khiva is victorious, and Turkestan has fallen. The capital of Turkestan, Bukhara, was not spared; its buildings burned and its riches plundered. Even army generals voiced concern over the unnecessary destruction of the legendary Ark fortress, now in ruins. Soldiers are reported to be massacring adult males whenever they see them and enslaving the rest despite threats of disciplinary action. What happened in Bukhara can be repeated throughout Turkestan, erasing their heritage and culture from the land so that they will never rise and challenge Chorasmia ever again. Alternatively, integration might be a more favorable method that would benefit the country in the long run. History shows that treating people unjustly will only hasten the oppressor's downfall. The Turks can be accepted as the new subjects of the Khawarazmshah and put their craftsmanship and chivalry to use."
 mnk_flavor.3.a: "Treating them harshly will only backfire"

 AB_Shahi_Waystation_title: "Control the Tarim Basin"
 AB_Shahi_Waystation_desc: "Now that the strategically important area of the Tarim Basin is under our direct control, we should look towards developing this land into a highley valuable center of commerce. Should we succeed at this, a monopolization of overland trade from China will secure our wealth for all time."
 AB_Shahi_Artistic_Revival_title: "Artistic Revival"
 AB_Shahi_Artistic_Revival_desc: "Kabulistan was once the center of a thriving Buddhist and Vedic artistic tradition. Taking inspiration from the older Hellenistic-Buddhist art of antiquity our art also fused Indian, central Asian and Chinese art forms into dazzling sculptures, murals, and statues. This tradition has long since vanished with the destruction wrought by the Mongols. If we are to take our place amongst the great kingdoms, sponsoring this art once more would be a step in the right direction."
 AB_Shahi_Buildingblocks_Nation_title: "Architectural Expansion"
 AB_Shahi_Buildingblocks_Nation_desc: "Our lands may be rich in trade and resources, but it is poor and undeveloped. This will not do, and we should begin the process of improving the infrastructure and wealth of our realm. If we are to take our place amongst the other great powers, we must develop our own lands!"
 AB_Shahi_National_Treasure_title: "National Treasure"
 AB_Shahi_National_Treasure_desc: "While our economic power is increasing by the day, much of Afghanistan remains poor and produces only meager goods. Our next step in Afghan development should be to improve this situation in our outer provinces and sponsor large scale production enterprises in order to spur economic growth in these lands."
 AB_Shahi_Urbanization_title: "Urbanise the Country"
 AB_Shahi_Urbanization_desc: "In eons past we have been known as the "land of ten thousand cities" but, in reality the vast majority of our realm is unsuitable for large scale urbanization due to its harsh mountains and hot deserts. If we are to keep up with our more geographically gifted neighbors, large scale infrastructure and urbanization efforts must take place. This will be a massive undertaking, involving both our best and brightest minds in the realm, as well as funding and support from our now blossoming merchant class."
 AB_Shahi_Ambitions_Industrialization_title: "Industrial Ambitions"
 AB_Shahi_Ambitions_Industrialization_desc: "The winds of change sweep through the world, and countries from Europe to China are begining to undertake massive societal changes, moving from agrarian socities to manufacturing based ones. Afghanistan will be no different, the time has come to step into this new age as a world power!"
 AB_Shahi_Economic_Hegemony_title: "Economic Hegemony"
 AB_Shahi_Economic_Hegemony_desc: "Through much difficulty and hardship, we have transformed Afghanistan from a tribal chiefdom into the most powerful empire the world has ever seen. Our manufacturies produce more valuable goods then anyone else, our merchants ply the water from China to Europe, and all around covet our vast wealth and resources. It is only just that we formalize this hegemony in the eyes of the rest of the world."
 AB_Shahi_Buddhist_Diplomacy_title: "Buddhist Diplomacy"
 AB_Shahi_Buddhist_Diplomacy_desc: "Ever since the mongol conquests, Buddhism abroad has been in a somewhat fragmented and isolated state. If we are to improve our prestige, we should look to reestablishing contact with our long lost brothers in faith."
 AB_Shahi_Confirming_Legitimacy_title: "Confirming Our Legitimacy"
 AB_Shahi_Confirming_Legitimacy_desc: "In order to be seen by the rest of the Asia as a great and formidable power, we must first establish ourselves as the legitimate rulers of our realm. In centuries past we once had the support of the Tang dynasty of China, on account of our shared Buddhist faith and location on the silk road. While the Tang have long since fallen, who could give better confirmation of our legitimacy then the dragon of the east?"
 AB_Shahi_Commercial_Power_title: "A Commercial Power"
 AB_Shahi_Commercial_Power_desc: "With our new found relations with China, and the our recent improvement to the development of our own lands, we should establish a stronger trade position abroad. By further developing our own lands and improving our trade infrastructure we can look to spur commercial investments as well as strengthen our merchant class."
 AB_Shahi_Caravanserai_title: "Adopt the Caravanserai"
 AB_Shahi_Caravanserai_desc: "Our position as a crossroads of the world is known far and wide, and if we were to improve the infrastructure of travel in our country, then surely more caravans would begin to travel through us and more importantly pay our taxes."
 AB_Shahi_Global_Market_title: "Global Market"
 AB_Shahi_Global_Market_desc: "We should look to once again become the economic center of the world, as we were under the Kushans and Bactrians. This is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination however, but if we became the most dominant trading power in both Persia and India we would surely set ourselves down the right path towards economic dominance."
 AB_Shahi_Center_World_title: "Center of the World"
 AB_Shahi_Center_World_desc: "With our influence in the global markets of Asia secured, we should use this new found power to re-center global trade in Afghanistan. Soon again, King, Khan, and Emperor will covet the land of ten thousand cities!"
 #Events:
 AB_Shahi_Event.1.T: "Indian Sweep"
 AB_Shahi_Event.1.D: "With our conquest of western India all but secured, the rest of the subcontinent lies within our grasp! The last major question we must answer is how "Indian" should we become? Many would think that our traditional ways are far superior to those of the Indians, while others think that there are many cultural aspects of the subcontinent that would be of great use to us should we decide to integrate ourselves more closely with India."
 AB_Shahi_Event.1.OPT1: "We shall strike fear into the heart of every Indian."
 AB_Shahi_Event.1.OPT2: "We shall merge the warriors of India into our own and create an army like no other."
 AB_Shahi_Event.2.T: "The Tarim Basin"
 AB_Shahi_Event.2.D: "Our take over and development of the Tarmin Basin has not gone without controversy in our own court. Many of the wealthy trading families of the Tarim have come to our court asking us if it would not be better to let them run the region for us, freeing up our administration to pursue other goals. While leaving this region in hands of competent traders seems to be beneficial, others in court argue that it would weaken our standing abroad. "
 AB_Shahi_Event.2.OPT1: "A lucrative deal indeed."
 AB_RELEASE_TCR_FOR_SHAHI:0 "We will release @TCR §Y[TCR.GetName]§! as our vassal in our owned provinces in the §YKashgaria§!, §YCentral Altishahr§!, and §YShanshan§! areas. We will annually receive a year's worth of their trade income as long as they are our §Ysubject§!."
 AB_Shahi_Event.2.OPT2: "Let us administer the region ourselves."
 AB_Shahi_Event.3.T: "Commercial Benefits"
 AB_Shahi_Event.3.D: "Our economic power is increasing exponentially, and we have recent news of it improving even further! It seems that many crafty merchants have managed to improve our revenue greatly through a mixture of competent planning and a laissez-faire approach to tariffs."
 AB_Shahi_Event.3.OPT1: "We shall put these ducats to good use."
 AB_Shahi_Event.4.T: "Afghan Silk"
 AB_Shahi_Event.4.D: "The development of industry in our provinces has been a major success! In an effort to improve the regions even further many of our advisors suggest bringing in silk to the regions, as it will surely provide much-needed economic stimulation. Others suggest a more level-headed approach."
 AB_Shahi_Event.4.OPT1: "We must fully invest in the Silk industry."
 AB_Shahi_Event.4.OPT2: "Let us encourage the local crafts instead."
 AB_Shahi_Event.5.T: "Right to Rule"
 AB_Shahi_Event.5.D: "Our mission to gain confirmation of our realm by the Chinese Emperor has been a great success! We are now the legitimate rulers of Kabul in the eyes of many. However, a fierce debate has been sparked in our court over our identity after the Chinese mission. Since our founding, it is our tribal structure of government that gives us our strength and power, keeping us fierce and strong. While this is all good, many of our new advisors are questioning if retaining this way of life is the best for stability and central control, as after all with legitimacy from China, we no longer need tribal relationships to retain power."
 AB_Shahi_Event.5.OPT1: "The title of Shah fits the Shahids."
 AB_Shahi_Event.5.OPT2: "We can never abandon our tribal traditions and values."
 AB_Shahi_Event.7.T: "Commercial Giants of the East"
 AB_Shahi_Event.7.D: "As the world increasingly begins to adopt globalization, our prime center at the heart of the world economy allows us to use these many new ideas of trade and economics to flourish our empire long before they reach the other cities of the world."
 AB_Shahi_Event.7.OPT1: "The fruit of our labour."
 AB_Shahi_Event.6.T: "Hidden"
 AB_Shahi_Event.6.D: "Hidden"
 AB_Shahi_Event.6.OPT1: "Hidden"
 AB_Shahi_Event.8.T: "Hidden"
 AB_Shahi_Event.8.D: "Hidden"
 AB_Shahi_Event.8.OPT1: "Hidden"
 # Decisions:
 AB_SHH_Recruit_Rajput_Regiments_title: "Recruit Indian Warriors"
 AB_SHH_Recruit_Rajput_Regiments_desc: "The Rajputs of India are famous for their skill with shields and swords, taught from a young age to be masters of martial arts. They were relied upon to fend off foreign invasions and were tenacious to any would-be conqueror. Using our connections with the Hindu Shahis, we can persuade them to fight on our side."
 AB_SHH_form_afghanistan_title: "Form Afghanistan"
 AB_SHH_form_afghanistan_desc: "In the graveyard of empires, many foreign conquerors tried to break the spirit of the Afghans and force them into submission, to no avail. Persians, Mongols, and Zunists all failed to dominate the region for a significant period of time. Until now, careful planning and decisive campaigning paved the way for Afghanistan to be under one banner. The division created after Sri Tegin and Rutbil Zabul is finally mended."

Born in Transoxiana in AD 1336, Timur started life as a lowly horse thief. After a failed raid left him permanently crippled in AD 1363, he renounced his past and converted to Nestorian Christianity.\n\nSaint Timur is most known for his conversion of the Chagatai Khanate, which was infamous for its persecutions of Nestorians and other Christians. He is also renowned amongst the Khitan and Assyrian communities for encouraging their desperate struggles for self-determination."

Kulun Beg's deposition and flight to the Syr Darya cemented our humiliation, but we have not wallowed in vain pity. For centuries we have struggled in vain for power, but at last with the folly of the so-called Great Khan's sons, we have become free. And we shall plunder and subjugate anyone that dares to attempts to enslave us again!"
 trk_second:0 "Legend of Kur-Shad"
 trk_second_desc:0 "Kur-Shad, a nobleman of our clan, once raided the Chinese Emperor's palace with 40 loyal soldiers. Even knowing that he would die, he struck out boldly, never hesitating to strike fear into the enemy's heart. As the centuries have passed Kur-Shad has become a mythical figure, a symbol of our ferocity and honour passed down generation to generation. Turkestan now stands strong, and Kur-Shad's legendary heroics have only strengthened our perception and honour."

Even though the once great site stands now as little more than scattered ruins, salted by the Chinese in their conquest of our homeland, we have kept the memory of Otuken alive. And when we return, it shall stand once more as not a traditional city, but a mobile metropolis."

Following the break up of the Khanate in the 14th Century, Togha would attempt to re-unify the empire from his power base in Gurgan.

Sacked by the Mongols during their conquest of Persia the city has never recovered. We should seek to restore Gurgan to its old glory, as a citadel as defensive as this will make for a fine capital in the our new Ilkhanate."
 GRG_fifth:0 "Crush the Great Houses"
 GRG_fifth_desc:0 "A century ago we ruled Persia and ushered in an era of prosperity to the whole region. The old Houses or Persia however, stabbed us in the back and sent us fleeing into the far reaches of our once great empire. We have learned from this mistake, and we now know that keeping the old Houses alive will only lead to more deception. If we are to hold onto Persia again, the Great Houses must be broken!"

This allows a certain amount of tolerance, and trade competency that many other empires and kings would envy."
 AFG_fourth:0 "Legacy of Empires"
 AFG_fourth_desc:0 "For eons Afghanistan has been home to many great empires. Situated strategically between Persia, India, and Asia, Afghanistan has access to many wealthy areas of expansion, grand empires such as the Bactrians, Kushans, and Hephthalites all chose to make their home in Afghanistan, and from there they conquered. It is only just that we continue this proud legacy."

 AFG_seventh:0 "Zamburaks"
 AFG_seventh_desc:0 "Zamburak, literally meaning wasp, was a specialized form of self-propelled artillery from the early modern period, featuring small swivel guns mounted on and fired from camels. Used to great effect by Iranian empires due to the ruggedness of the Iranian Plateau which made transportation of cannons difficult. A zamburak consisted of a soldier on a camel with a mounted swivel gun hinged on a metal fork-rest protruding from the camel's saddle. To fire it, the camel was put on its knees. It provided heavy firepower and flexibility to the armies of many early-modern Persian states."

Let us look to new innovative tactics of battlefield fortifications, and heavily armoured soldiers in order to counter the Mongol horsemen and safeguard our realm from their savagery."
 MNK_second:0 "Manichaean Adherents"
 MNK_second_desc:0 "We are the last followers of the true faith, and the wisdom of Mani. Founded in the 3rd century AD by the Parthian Mani, the dualistic faith of light and dark would flourish during late antiquity, and along the silk road. The religion reached its heights during the Manichaean Uyghur Khanate, who dominated the silk road during the 8th and 9th centuries. With the collapse of the Uyghur empire the remaining Manichaeans would find their home in Khiva, were they dominate the region to this day. Despite everything and everyone, we are still here."
 MNK_third:0 "Refound the Chorasmian Medical School"
 MNK_third_desc:0 "Long before the Mongols burned their way through Chorasmia, the region was known for having some of the most renowned scientific centres in the world, the Chorasmian Medical School. Through patronage of native rulers, this school was one of the most important contributors to the study of medicine in the whole of Asia. Under our rule, we should look to refund and patronise this institution, and re-establish Khiva as the foremost scientific centre of the silk road."
 MNK_fourth:0 "Renovate Khiva"
 MNK_fourth_desc:0 "Once Chorasmia was home to some of the most splendid cities of the Silk Road, cities such as Urgench and Gurganj. While these days have long since passed, and the Mongol dominance has done its damage, we must seek to regain some of this old glory. Our new rulers shall build new cities starting with Khiva, and restore the irrigation systems and splendour of the old days."
 MNK_fifth:0 "Sogdian Connections"
 MNK_fifth_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the Sogdians have greatly facilitated the silk road becoming as lucrative as it has become. If one is to dominate the wealth of Asia, the Sogdians must be involved. We should use our ties religiously, politically, and financially to incentivise Sogdian merchants to favour us when they come to trade their goods."
 MNK_sixth:0 "Persianate Society"
 MNK_sixth_desc:0 "While we may not be in Persia, Chorasmia has long had a strong connection to that great realm. From the Iranian dynasties that ruled Khiva, to our own Manichaean faith, which has strong persian elements itself, we view ourselves as part of Greater Persia. Let us continue this trend and make Persian language and customs the bedrock of our realm, whether it be culturally, administratively, or scientifically."
 MNK_seventh:0 "Establish the Vulboshi"
 MNK_seventh_desc:0 "Times are changing, and surrounded on all sides with enemies, we must seek to make a truly modern and professional military. By establishing a centralised command structure under the management of a group of top officials known as the Vulbushi, we can ensure our new army will be professionally trained, led, and supplied by an organised officer core. With these reforms, Khiva will dominate the other realms of Central Asia."

Of course, we are still a horde - but long gone are the days of Pyramids of Skulls, as was our ancestor Temujin’s custom.

With labyrinthine webs of loyalties and conflicts keeping sharp both blades drawn in the sun and daggers drawn in the night, the schemes of our nobility give our state an edge at intrigue that few can match."
 mgs_seventh:0 "Baptismal Records"
 mgs_seventh_desc:0 "As per Christian tradition, once a church baptizes someone - usually from birth - our local priests dutifully record their name in a book stored inside the church itself. This has an unexpected bonus for our government - it makes it far easier to know where to look for fresh conscripts, as well as catch those who attempt to dodge their orders, greatly expanding our pool of recruits to choose from.

Alongside his brothers, concubines, wives and potential heirs, his inherent illegitimacy, cowardice and failure were declared for the whole world to hear, mouthed by the lips of our Shah himself.

Great blasts and heavenly shudders echo across the city as irreparable, eternal damage rains down upon its inhabitants and structures alike. The Hagia Sophia crumbles in on itself - the building appearing mortified, sorrowful, pillars embracing one another as the ancient structure finally gives in. The foolish scripts within were dashed to the stone, set alight, much to the wailing horror of its diligent establishment.

The Wailing Wall was presented to a cannon that had been brought into the city.

Nothing came - and after the barrage, some say pieces of the brickwork could be found as far away as Gaza. Every cross in the city, great and small, has been burned.

There, on the ground, they beheld our Shah declaring the impotence of their faith - followed by the desecration, burning and obliteration of the Kaaba. Once every last brick had fallen, the Shah's decree of abstinence was wavered, martial law falling to the wayside. Mecca was sacked, brutally and beyond repair, over the course of a week.

 ab_persia.22.d:0 "Even as a small child, Tishtar’s father Yazdgerd saw that she had been set apart from her siblings by Ahura Mazda. A bright and inquisitive girl, it soon became apparent to Yazdgerd that her natural talents would be wasted as a bargaining chip in Ilkhanid politics, and sent her to the grand city of Marv to be given an education worthy of a queen. While away in Marv, she astonished her tutor in her knack for classical Iranian architecture, drawing up several detailed sketches all her own based off of old Achaemenid models. Her abilities were not limited to just a single field though. Through the careful nurturing of her tutor, she was able to become adept in the fields of rhetoric, philosophy, and statecraft. It is said as she was preparing to leave for Nishapur once more, that her tutor remarked: “Her tongue is as sharp as that of Aristotle, and her vision as grand as Isidore of Miletus.\n\nHer return to Nishapur, however, was not so warmly regarded. In her absence, her eldest brother Peroz had taken over after her father had passed away. Threatened by her natural charm and talent, Peroz had her confined to house arrest in all but name within her chambers not long after she returned. Unfortunately for House Mihran however, Peroz was more preoccupied with his many palace maids than stabilizing the realm after the Ilkhanid collapse. As Peroz’s many deficiencies began to reveal themselves to the court, Tishtar was able to persuade them to her cause, and gradually able to build up an underground support network amongst the nobility in Nishapur.\n\nThe final straw came when Peroz sought to offer Tishtar in marriage to the upstart lowborn Shapur. Not only did this incense Tishtar, but most of the nobility also. To marry off a Mihranid princess to a glorified merchant was unacceptable to them, and Tishtar finally had the support she needed to launch her plan into action. While on a hunting trip with his son outside Sabzevar, Peroz fell victim to an unfortunate accident when one of his retainers misfir e d and struck the king and his young heir instead of the tiger they had been pursuing. The new queen, in an act of supreme clemency, pardoned the retainer after assessing he had not premeditated the killing of her elder brother. From there on, Tishtar would prove herself to be a wise and capable ruler, patronizing many former Ilkhanid courtiers who had lost their jobs after its untimely demise, and even contributing her own writings to the library at Nishapur. As she approaches 40 years of age with many years of wise governorship behind her, it is clear Tishtar “the Wise” will go down as one of Persia’s most capable rulers."

 ab_persia.23.d:0 "At the beginning of the Ilkhanate’s downfall, not many would have placed their bets on a humble merchant from Hormirzad rising to become pre-eminent inheritor of the Varazid legacy. Yet, Shapur was an exceptional man even before he became known as “the Great”. As a young man, Shapur fought as a local mercenary for the Ilkhanate, putting down rebellions and fighting against other successors of Temujin on the Ilkhanate’s behalf, distinguishing himself as a clever and brave soldier, and eventually, officer. Shapur eventually retired from mercenary work altogether, pooling his funds into an overseas enterprise contracting Indian spice merchants and selling their wares in his home city. Employing the services of the fearsome Rajputs as caravan guards for his cargo.\n\nAs the Ilkhanate began to buckle under its own weight, however, fate would have Shapur enter battle once more - this time, against the Ilkhanid governor of Mogostan. Like with most of the other Persian and Mongol nobility, he ouste d the Borjigins and began fighting with other warlords for the throne of Eranshahr. However, to fund his wars he had placed crippling taxes on Shapur and his fellow merchants, and the wily Shapur saw his chance to bounce. He formed a coalition of dissatisfied merchants and local commanders, and demanded the governor reverse his policies. He refused, and so Shapur’s army surrounded the palace at Hormirzad. The governor, confident in his strength of numbers, sallied out and met Shapur in open battle. However, through careful maneuvering and personal command of his Rajput mercenaries, Shapur was able, against all odds, to overcome the governor, who committed suicide not long after he saw his defeat. The notable merchants in the city then surrendered the city to Shapur, who proceeded to reverse all the unpopular tax policies in Hormirzad.\n\nDespite his low birth, his shrewd and lenient policies with the lower and middle classes legitimized him in the eyes of most, with the merchants of Hormirzad even calling a v ote to rechristen the city “Shapurshahr” in his honor. Shapur’s ambitions would not stop there, however, and he would go on to depose other weak Ilkhanid successors in Sistan and Khorasan, as well as fighting a lightning campaign against the Sassanids for control of Isfahan. Now, as the Great Shapur grows to a ripe old age, it is clear his legacy will secure his future heirs a legitimacy just as prestigious as Iranian Great Houses of old."

As we were searching through her belongings to distribute them according to her will, we discovered completed schematics of a new fortress-city just outside Nishapur proper. Heavily inspired by ancient Achaemenid architectural motifs and named after its eponymous designer, it would be connected to Nishapur proper by a thick stone wall, which would be linked with Nishapur’s already existing fortifications. As for the interior of the city, it would of course be host to a grand palace, as well as a new royal academy, and an expansive residential area within the city walls for the most important scholars, architects, and artisans. Lastly, the palace itself would be host to an imposing citadel that looked out over the whole of the city, where the garrison could hide out in case the exterior walls were somehow breached and give the army additional time to intercept enemy fo rces. If we were to commission the royal architects to bring these schematics to life, they would no doubt bring unprecedented grandeur to our realm - however, the cost and planning needed for such an undertaking gives our treasurer pause about setting the project into motion."

Exasperated to the ends of his wit, the Basileus had complained throughout the diplomatic mission that the Persians would hide him and have his guts for garters. Of course, nobody expected such fears would come to fruition in the most literal sense. After dismissing the other diplomats, the Basileus was forced to prostrate before the Shah and his entourage, although his readiness to sell out Byzantium in exchange for his own life is ironically what sealed his fate. After the deed was done, the Basileus' flayed remains were catapulted over the walls of Constantinople and into the city's Palace District, while the Imperial Pelt found itself hoisted atop the Shah's tent as if it were his own standard. The Basileus' gilded skull, fashioned i nto an ornate drinking cup, was subsequently gifted to the Sofia branch of Osman & Sons, where it now sits upon the Chief Executive Vizier's desk.
