 #Pannonia
 pnn_baptism_title:0 "Baptism in the Danube"
 pnn_baptism_desc:0 "The Magyars, despite living in the heart of Europe for centuries, still cling to their heathen practices. However, the majority of those who would call themselves Magyar share our blood and our heritage, and as our kin they can be redeemed. Thus they must be Christianised in order to save their souls and allow them to be a proper part of our state."
 pnn_river_title:0 "Push Past the River"
 pnn_river_desc:0 "The tenuous balance of Carpathia has finally been broken, as the Magyars once more try to push west, beyond the Danube. This is an existential threat, not only to us, but to the whole Slavic world. If the Magyars are not stopped here, who's to stop them at all? We must push past the Danube and secure land that hadn't been held by Slavs for centuries in order to ensure our people may have a future not under the boot of nomadic conquerors."
 pnn_inevitable_title:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 pnn_inevitable_desc:0 "The status quo in the Carpathian Basin is tenuous at best. For centuries the Magyars have been kept at bay across the great Danube river, but with Moravia's power waning, they are sure to make a move. We must prepare, as conflict, at this point, seems inevitable."
 pnn_plains_title:0 "The Eastern Plains"
 pnn_plains_desc:0 "The plains of Eastern Pannonia are a far cry from the fertile lands around the Danube river. Even the Magyars have taken to referring to it with a Slavic word, "Puszta", denoting its flat and empty character. Because of this, the Magyars found themselves right at home here, reminded of their old homelands to the east. The power of the Magyars may have been diminished, but it is not yet broken, and we must beat them in their home turf to finally be safe from their threat."
 pnn_bend_title:0 "The Southern Bend"
 pnn_bend_desc:0 "The Eastern part of the mighty Carpathian mountains surrounds the Pannonian basin from all sides as it bends southward and then westward. A mighty natural barrier, which we must secure to ensure there will be no more nomadic invasions from the East. As it happens, it is also the final Magyar holdout within our basin. Take it, and our state will finally be secure within its natural borders."
 pnn_never_title:0 "Never Again"
 pnn_never_desc:0 "Carpathia has a long history of being invaded from the East by nomadic hordes. The Huns, Avars and Magyar, all came, saw and conquered this fertile land. Times are, however, changing and we shall never let this happen again. Our eastern flank will be guarded by impenetrable fortifications and our people may finally rest easy."
 pnn_glagolitic_title:0 "Modernise the Glagolitic"
 pnn_glagolitic_desc:0 "The Glagolitic script was created by the brothers Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius in 863 to help spread the Orthodox faith in Moravia. While its use has changed over the years with conflict between Catholics and Orthodox, it still stands as the clerical script used in Pannonia. By standardising the script, we will eliminate any possibility of misinterpreting the holy scripture." 
 pnn_religious_reforms_title:0 "Religious Reforms" 
 pnn_religious_reforms_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church of Pannonia has always been threatened by the Papists in the west and Pagan hordes surrounding us from the east. The people of Pannonia need guidance in these trying times. Churches must be constructed across the lands and all priests must be convened to solidify Orthodox teaching across the realm." 
 pnn_mining_title:0 "Transylvanian Mining Towns"
 pnn_mining_desc:0 "There is great wealth hiding in the Southeastern Carpathians, wealth that has gone unexploited for far too long. The local inhabitants of Transylvania lack much of the expertise required for setting up large-scale mining operations. We must settle the region with Slavic experts from Western and Northern Pannonia in order to fully tap the riches hiding within the mountains."
 pnn_christ_title:0 "Christianise the Magyars"
 pnn_christ_desc:0 "Whether we like it or not, the Magyars have become a core part of the Pannonian basin's cultural makeup. The times of them being foreign invaders is long gone, as they have made this land their home, just as we have. Many Christian Magyars are already our loyal subjects and serve in our armies as very capable cavalrymen. It is clear that the Magyars can be civilised, but they all must abandon their old ways and be brought into Christ's embrace."
 pnn_peaks_title:0 "Recover Nitrava"
 pnn_peaks_desc:0 "Our victories against the Magyars may have bought us some time, but our position remains vulnerable. On our northern border our Moravian cousins look towards our territorial gains with hungry eyes, eager to reclaim lost glories of a past empire. While the Danube provides some defence from would-be invaders from the North, if they do manage to cross the river, our lands are open and difficult to defend. Our only option is to expand north and push towards the tallest peaks of the Carpathian mountains, which no enemy would dare cross."
 pnn_kremnica_title:0 "Golden Kremnica"
 pnn_kremnica_desc:0 "The gold mines of Kremnica have barely reached their peak potential, and we are missing out on a serious source of income. Mines must be expanded of course, but constructing a mint will allow us to mine the gold and mint out coinage at the same time. The wealth generated from this will of course go to the army, but maybe we could afford to siphon some of it to the average citizen."
 pnn_rudohorie_title:0 "Riches of Rudohorie"
 pnn_rudohorie_desc:0 "The rolling hills and mountains of the Northern Carpathians contain large deposits of gold, silver, iron and other metals, which is why the region has been named "Rudohorie", meaning ore mountains. We should exploit these natural riches in order to arm our men and fund our campaigns."
 pnn_pannonia_title:0 "Fortress Pannonia"
 pnn_pannonia_desc:0 "The entire Carpathian basin is now in our hands and our natural borders have finally been achieved. However, even the greatest of natural barriers surrounding our lands is useless if it remains unguarded. Forts shall be built, garrisons reinforced, our armies drilled, in order to never let anyone else take what is ours from us again."
 pnn_danubian_title:0 "The Danubian Trade"
 pnn_danubian_desc:0 "The presence of the hostile Magyars has long limited the trade that flows up and down the Danube. Now that the entire Pannonian basin is firmly integrated into the Christian world, we are ready to start shipping goods on one of Europe's greatest rivers and earn great wealth doing so."
 pnn_ragusa_title:0 "Ragusa Trade Deals"
 pnn_ragusa_desc:0 "Ragusa, pearl of the Adriatic and second most famous city on its shores. The first is, of course, Venice, which also happens to be the destination of many merchants that choose to stop there on their way to German markets instead of taking the overland route through Pannonia. This has to stop. Negotiating a trade deal with Ragusa will allow us to pull trade away from Venice and towards Pannonia."
 pnn_constantinople_title:0 "Constantinople Trade Deals"
 pnn_constantinople_desc:0 "Constantinople, the City of the World's Desire. Given this title for a good reason, the great city has recently been hotly contested. No matter who came out on top, the city remains a jewel of the world, and crucial to the transdanubian trade. No matter who came out on top in the fight for the city, we must establish trade contacts and ensure that we have a great deal of control over the trade that flows from Constantinople into Europe. And if the power that holds Constantinople is a hostile one, we shall get our way, by force if necessary."
 pnn_crimea_title:0 "Crimea Trade Deals"
 pnn_crimea_desc:0 "Though we may not directly be involved in it, the Black Sea is nonetheless crucial for our trade ventures. The Danube delta is an entrypoint for the wealth of the East into Europe, and we must fully capitalise on this. Those who rule Crimea also hold great sway over the comings and goings of the eastern trade and earn great riches as a result. We must establish trade deals with the masters of the peninsula, one way or another, in order to secure our position on the world stage."
 pnn_hegemon_title:0 "Trade Hegemon"
 pnn_hegemon_desc:0 "We have done what many would have thought impossible. Though the core of our nation is landlocked, we have turned into a veritable trade hegemon and serve as a vital artery connecting Northern and Southern Europe. Now it is time to reap the rewards."
 pnn_black_soil_title:0 "The Black Soil"
 pnn_black_soil_desc:0 "Pannonia is home to some of the most fertile soil in Europe. If we take good care of it and treat it well, we may yet become a major food producer for all of Europe."
 pnn_basket_title:0 "Breadbasket of Europe"
 pnn_basket_desc:0 "By carefully managing our fertile soil we have become a true breadbasket for Europe. Pannonian grain is shipped far and wide, and Pannonian livestock is the envy of all."
 pnn_intensify_title:0 "Intensify the Mining"
 pnn_intensify_desc:0 "Vast amounts of wealth remain untapped within the mountains. The easily accessible veins of ore are running low and we must dig harder and deeper to keep up."
 pnn_develop_title:0 "Develop the Mining Cities"
 pnn_develop_desc:0 "The Mining cities of Nitra and Transylvania are a cornerstone of our economy. We must further invest into them, as the return on the investments will no doubt be worthwhile."
 pnn_heart_title:0 "The Heart of Europe"
 pnn_heart_desc:0 "Pannonia, long considered a hopeless backwater, has risen to be one of the biggest economic powerhouses on the continent, able to compete with the likes of Britannia and Francia. Pannonia is the beating heart of Europe, and it may remain so for the foreseeable future."
 pnn_mountain_title:0 "Fortify the North"
 pnn_mountain_desc:0 "Now that the we have a rich and defensible area of Nitra under our control in the north, we must start to defend it. By fortifying this area we can hope to defend the realm while also building a stronger militaristic tradition in our borders."
 pnn_diocese_title:0 "Diocese of Pannonia"
 pnn_diocese_desc:0 "While our church has grown considerably stronger in recent times, we should aim to make it stronger still. Let us seek to strengthen it's authority and its size among our subjects. In return our church will help stimulant growth in our provinces."
 pnn_slavonia_title:0 "Secure Slavonia"
 pnn_slavonia_desc:0 "If we are to secure our position, we must extend our border in the south. The fertile plains of slavonia are a prime target for this, and we can use them a spring board for potential expansion into the Adriatic in the future."
 pnn_croatia_title:0 "Illyrian Advance"
 pnn_croatia_desc:0 "By expanded into Croatia we not only destroy a potential competitor, increasing our influence in the balkans more, but we can now gain access to the lucrative Adriatic trade. With our south secure, we can begin prepartions to even invade Italy, should we desire."
 #Hetmanate
 htm_raise_host_title:0 "Raise the Host"
 htm_raise_host_desc: "The time has come to seize initiative. For too long, our ancient plains, once a heartland of all the peoples of Europe and beyond, have been a bloody battleground, torn between foul-breathed steppe conquerors and grovelling Norsemen. Let us raise a host of riders that will invoke fear - inspiring terror amidst not only the bustling streets of Krakow, but also the treacherous reaches of Sarai."
 htm_tame_title:0 "Tame the Wild Fields"
 htm_tame_desc:0 "The steppe is like the sea - its bountiful horizons offer freedom, fortune and an expanse beyond one's wildest dreams, though it is not composed of bountiful waves, but instead glimmering grasslands. One commonality not to be ignored, however, is the treachery and violence that may run abound in the form of bandits, Mongols and the threats of the wilderness - as well as the eternal challenge of distant rivals awaiting us past the eastern horizon. Let us dominate this wilderness, until our hetmanate is a beast for all the world to fear."
 htm_dnieper_title:0 "Advance Along the Dniepr"
 htm_dnieper_desc:0 "It is only natural that the hetmanate reclaim the mother city of Kyiv - the beating heart of the world of our forefathers. We shall brush aside the squabbling princes, thieving marauders, and greedy landowners to bring this beloved heartland back into our fold."
 htm_mother_title:0 "The Mother of Cities"
 htm_mother_desc:0 "According to the Primary Chronicle of the great Saint Nestor, Kyiv was founded in ancient times by three legendary brothers, headed by the noble Kyi. Having endured centuries of assaults, sieges, raids, escapades and humiliations, this proud city must not be allowed to decline any further. To honour the memory of Kyi and our ancestors alike, we must empower the great Kyiv, making it a booming metropolis to rival the likes of Czargrad, Novgorod and Rome."
 htm_metropolitane_title:0 "Metropolitan of Kyiv"
 htm_metropolitane_desc:0 "With our proud capital restored and elevated to previously unseen heights, rife with booming markets, raging ports, hearty garrisons and a sprawling keep for our rulers, it is only fitting that we now turn our attention to pleasing the most important and most cherished members of our hetmanate - Jesus Christ and the Lord. Let us dedicate our wealth and resources not to extravagance in the name of material, worldly deeds, but the power of the almighty."
 htm_infiltrate_title: "Infiltrate the Horde"
 htm_infiltrate_desc: "To the east, the wily Mongols gather anew - raging against internal rebellions and struggling with their rampant tribal strife. It is said that a heavy wallet can get you anywhere within their lands - so a spy network will not only prove easy enough to build, but also prove to be of massive detriment to their indecisive leadership. Let us wreak havoc amidst their ranks and prepare our revenge."
 htm_princes_title:0 "Unite the Princes"
 htm_princes_desc:0 "For too long, Ruthenia has laid divided. Outsiders have run amok, princes have squabbled and bickered, and many a prospective farmer has suffered at the hands of incessant violence beyond his control. No more - Ruthenia must come under our banner."
 htm_defy_title:0 "Defy the Khagan"
 htm_defy_desc:0 "With the Khagan's whimsical 'administration' in tatters, exposed at every level by our fearless spies, we must make haste. The peoples of Yedisan and the Crimea cry out for our liberation - let us give it to them and spit in the face of Mongol oppression."
 htm_ruthenia_title:0 "Reunite Ruthenia"
 htm_ruthenia_desc:0 "With our supremacy established and made clear, Ruthenia must respect us properly. Let us make a proclamation to all peoples of Rus' - that we are their masters and the heirs to this greatest of histories."
 htm_crimea_title:0 "Claim Crimea"
 htm_crimea_desc:0 "The Crimean peninsula stands as an intensely contested region. Goths, Byzantines, Mongols and worst of all, undoubtedly by the Devil's wicked doing, Italian traders, have laid claim to the humble peninsula - for it is a vital artery of trade and a port of great potential. Let us drive out the competition and claim the area for ourselves."
 htm_azov_title:0 "Conquer Azov"
 htm_azov_desc:0 "Azov is a humble, yet vital coastal haven. Many fertile grasslands stretch across the region's extent. Unruly steppe fiends have made it their home for far too long - it would make a much better place for our proud and hearty Cossacks to settle and make their own."
 htm_coalition_title:0 "Anti-Mongol Coalition"
 htm_coalition_desc:0 "There stands a common goal within all stricken by adjacency to the Golden Horde - freedom from Mongol wickedness. Divided, we will fall and wither away beneath centuries of oppression. Together, we may drive out our enemies once and for all. Let us forge friendships, build trust and proclaim leadership of a new coalition against the Mongol menace."
 htm_sarai_title:0 "Sack Sarai"
 htm_sarai_desc:0 "Sarai stands as a disgusting testimony - the testimony of Mongol conquest, for they have swept through a region not of their own and had the audacity to found an indignant city on the shores of a once beautiful river. Let us shatter the spirit of the horde by shattering their heart. We must ruin Sarai."
 htm_dismantle_title:0 "Dismantle the Golden Horde"
 htm_dismantle_desc:0 "Triumph echoes throughout our armies. Songs of victory are cried out across the countryside. Already, the poets weep with joy at the destruction wrought upon the Mongols, the vengeance rightfullly exacted. The battle is not yet over, however. The battle is not yet over until not a single Mongol banner stands west of the Urals. Let us carry out this obliteration once and for all."
 htm_novgorod_title:0 "Control Novgorod"
 htm_novgorod_desc:0 "Novgorod is an ancient city - founded many centuries ago to bring about peace and cohesion among proud and rowdy tribes. Today it is a vital heart of trade - ruled over by greedy and incompetent men. This proud city, boasting tidy streets, widespread literacy and rich culture, must be brought under our rule."
 htm_rurik_title:0 "Dethrone the Rurikovichs"
 htm_rurik_desc:0 "For centuries, the Rurikovichs have proven themselves incompetent. The Rus’ require a strong leader. Who better than us - we who dared to defy the Mongols, dared to reunite and gather our people, dared to stare down outside oppression and crush all who challenge us with a stampede of galliant Cossack cavalry. Let us see to it that not only these fools are dethroned, but also driven extinct."
 htm_rus_title:0 "Heir of Rus'"
 htm_rus_desc:0 "With our enemies wiped from the plate that is Europe, our borders stretching from wild east to civilised west, frigid north to treacherous south, we may finally proclaim ourselves heir of Rus'. Novgorod booms within our grasp, Kyiv glitters with gold and all the princes prosper beneath our valiant Cossack might. Finally, we may complete our conquest of Rus' - and with it, stand unchallenged forevermore."
 htm_ural_title:0 "Reach Ural"
 htm_ural_desc:0 "In the distant east, vast and formidable mountains run abound from the south, reaching the farthest, coldest north. Beyond them, our fearless Cossacks reckon, there lay untouched, unclaimed, undisturbed wilderness - trifled with by vagrants, tribes and wanderers, yes, but nothing that is a match for our unstoppable host. Let us conquer these proud mountains!"
 htm_west_siberian_towns_title:0 "Found New Towns"
 htm_west_siberian_towns_desc:0 "Siberia lays within our control, with routes, roads and villages blossoming. However, the prosperity of Kyiv, Novgorod and the other jewels of the west dwarf the sorry, humble likes of our new holdings. Let us create fully-fledged towns, making these little settlements true population centres, true cities, true homes."
 htm_west_siberia_title:0 "Siberian Expedition"
 htm_west_siberia_desc:0 "Having crossed the hardy Urals, we may finally set foot into the vast wilderness of Siberia. Cossacks stand eager to venture out east, striking into rife, virgin wilderness. Let us make haste and expand our borders where no empire has dared expand before."
 htm_east_siberia_title:0 "Reach the Pacific"
 htm_east_siberia_desc:0 "Our Cossacks have leapt from west to east and discovered, awaiting us at the other end of vast and beautiful Siberia, a seemingly endless sea - rivalling that of not only the great White Sea to the north, but even the fabled Atlantic, where Franks, Anglos and Saracens alike sail arrogantly. The coastline which lays at the behest of this cold and beautiful expanse boasts a rich fur trade - perhaps if we were to settle it, we could dip a finger in its pie."
 htm_fur_trade_title:0 "Control the Fur Trade"
 htm_fur_trade_desc:0 "Our far eastern coastline lies within our hands - but the endless hunger of our merchants is not yet sated. Our Cossacks also cry out for more adventure, their appetite proving insatiable. Let us push them into a new pursuit - that of dominance in the noble fur trade."
 htm_urbanize_title:0 "Urbanize the Steppe"
 htm_urbanize_desc:0 "Decades of warfare against the Mongols have wrought havoc upon peaceful grasslands. We sought to liberate this region from tyranny - yet the mark of warfare, the taint of bloodshed and the echoes of destruction live on. We must give back to the beaten and battered peoples of the steppe, urbanising and restoring what once was, to bring the region to even greater economic heights."
 htm_expand_title:0 "Expand Stanitsas"
 htm_expand_desc:0 "Our ambitions are plentiful and our plans for the steppe are extensive. It is only fitting that we expand our array of stanitsas - military localities - to enrich our pool of manpower with new recruits and make from our booming population new Cossacks."
 htm_reform_title:0 "Reform the Sich"
 htm_reform_desc:0 "The Sich - a gallant and decisive stratocratic military force based within the steppe - has won many a victory against and written many a devastating letter, rife with insults, to foul-breathed and pig-headed foes abroad. Its might is undeniable, its honour vast, yet it remains, admittedly, an angry and disorganised rabble. If we were to reform the Sich, however, empowering their minds as much as we do their seemingly bottomless stomachs and hunger for land and bloodshed, they could become a powerful arm of our Hetmanate's government."  
 htm_untamed_title:0 "Untamed Horde"
 htm_untamed_desc:0 "With our resurgent strength and valiant and plentiful victories, we have proclaimed to the world not only Cossack military superiority, but also Cossack hegemony. Let us create not only the largest, but also the most fearsome army the world has ever seen - and rattle, shake and shatter the bones of our enemies with terror alone. Not only the steppe, but also the conceited likes of Europe, will tremble before the Cossack behemoth we shall make of our military forces."

 ven_greece_title:0 "Partition Greece"
 ven_greece_desc:0 "The Greeks were once worthy of respect, however their propensity for falling into civil war over the most petty disputes has taken its toll. The Byzantine Empire, once viewed as an at least semi-legitimate Roman successor, is now the worst joke ever told; a failed state compared to its neighbours and trade partners. The hubris so commonly punished in their own literature has clouded the Greeks, and it is to this end that the Venetians must put them in their place. Greece shall be cut down to size and then some."
 ven_thrace_title:0 "Avenge the Fourth Crusade"
 ven_thrace_desc:0 "The Fourth Crusade was ultimately the perfect time for Venice to strike at the terminus of trade into Europe, Constantinople, under the false pretense of ferrying forces headed to the Holy Land. Alas, the deceptions never fully paid off, as the stubborn Byzantines crushed the mercenary army and set the Venetian fleet alight following a lengthy blockade. This wound has cut deep enough to tarnish Venice's prestige and standing amongst other European realms; the gravest of insults, and one which must be avenged no matter how high the toll rises."

Although they started off primarily dedicated to charitable activities, over the ages their purposes have gradually expanded, and now many of them support such varied activities as music, the arts, and medicine. Patronizing these organizations would go a long way towards endearing ourselves to the well-to-do citizens who run and fill out the ranks of these institutions."
 ven_palace_title:0 "The Seat of the Government"

 ven_standardize_relazioni_desc:0 "The 'Relazioni' are the reports our ambassadors send to the government, detailing the political, financial, and social state of the countries they serve in. These documents are essential for both our own diplomatic efforts and for maintaining the competitive advantage of our merchants abroad, but it is an increasingly common practice for copies of relazioni to be published and made available to anybody willing to pay a high price for them. This is a threat to our own diplomacy and security. We must crack down on these publications, and establish a common, secure system for the writing and dissemination of relazioni."

 ven_promote_the_carnevale_desc:0 "Our famous carnival dates back to 1162 and our magnificent victory over the Patriarch of Aquileia. Since then, the festivities have become even grander, the costumes more ornate, and the celebrations all the more decadent. Quite frankly, its magnificence is all out of proportion for what it's supposed to celebrate, but we can use that to our advantage. The more we expose foreign diplomats to the grandeur of Carnevale, the faster word of our opulence shall spread."
 ven_ducale_title:0 "Promissione Ducale"
 ven_ducale_desc:0 "The Promissione Ducale is the oath of office all candidates must swear by to become the new Doge of Venice. It outlines the duties of the Doge, and states the limits on the Doge's powers. Over the years, however, some of the checks have... waned, a little. If we were to draft a new primissione ducale, one that more firmly restates our values and the roles envisioned for the Doge, not only would our government be strengthened, but more virtuous candidates for office might step forward as well."
 ven_wars_title:0 "The Italian Wars"
 ven_wars_desc:0 "The Italian Peninsula has become a hotbed, nay, a powderkeg, in recent times. From invading Muslims to ambitious warlords, the stability of this region is likely to further spiral into oblivion. It would be prudent to take advantage of this age of conflict, because despite her destiny to rule the sea, Venice regardless benefits from continental commitments. Make it so."
 ven_ravenna_title:0 "Connect Ravenna"
 ven_ravenna_desc:0 "Ravenna, the former capital of the long-dissolved Western Roman Empire, proved to be one of Venice's greatest war-prizes against the Lombards. Alas, it is nonetheless isolated from the Republic's other continental holdings by land. This leaves it vulnerable to attack or rebellion if reinforcements don't come by ship soon enough - something which the Doge's military advisors haven't overlooked. It is time this crisis in the making sees itself preemptively rectified."
 ven_dominate_title:0 "Reign in the North"
 ven_dominate_desc:0 "Blessed with fertile farmland and serving as home to the most well-developed of the Italian cities, the north is nonetheless suffering. The rule of the Lombards has been nothing short of burdensome, in no small part due to their constant propensity for engaging in warfare. By consolidating Venetian rule in the north, a new era of prosperity can begin."
 ven_dock_title:0 "Expand the Dock"
 ven_dock_desc:0 "Venice's docks are truly a sight to behold; bustling with sailors and thriving from merchant traffic. Aside from gangpressing, staffing the navy stems primarily from recruiting at these maritime hubs. Of course, as the fleet expands, the need for fresh blood does too. By expanding these docks, the thalassocracy will no doubt be all the stronger for it."
 ven_flagship_title:0 "Launch a Flagship"
 ven_flagship_desc:0 "The Venetian fleet suffered catastrophic losses to Byzantine saboteurs while blockading Constantinople in 1204, with much of the fleet reduced to smouldering hulks just barely floating atop the water. Most shamefully, the Republic's flagship was destroyed, leaving the navy without a vessel to rally around. With the economy in a much better state than it was prior, the Doge has become deadset on launching a new flagship for his new navy."
 ven_admiralty_title:0 "Venetian Admiralty"
 ven_admiralty_desc:0 "The leadership of Venice's navy is often disunited, bickering amongst themselves like the petty nobles and fat traders they are. Without a doubt the most detrimental element of the Republic's army at this point, the creation of an admiralty board which can decide on maritime policy independently from the Great Council would be a great boon."
 ven_genoa_title:0 "Dominate Genoa"
 ven_genoa_desc:0 "The swindlers and charlatans of Genoa have been a thorn in the Most Serene Republic's side for many centuries. From cumbersome trade conflicts in the Levant to aiding the pirates of Sicily, the line has long since been crossed. It is high time that the Lion of Saint Mark asserts itself as the dominant trade power in the Mediterranean."
 ven_isles_title:0 "Seize the Isles"
 ven_isles_desc:0 "The isles are of critical importance to the Venetian military, and ambitions across the Mediterranean. By serving as naval outposts, which can act as springboards for future expansion, Venice will have the edge it needs to come out on top of the other powers vying for naval supremacy."
 ven_nostrum_title:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 ven_nostrum_desc:0 "The Most Serene Republic of Venice's future is one in which the thalassocracy reigns supreme across the Mediterranean. By ensuring the navy is completely unrivalled at sea and the armies are unbeatable on land, by consolidating the lands of Italy and beyond, Venice will be able to declare Mare Nostrum; the sea shall belong to the merchant republic and them alone."
 ven_roman_title:0 "The Roman Resolution"
 ven_roman_desc:0 "Rome, the beating heart of Italy, has seen much better days. Even still, it proves a most illustrious city with enough prestige contained within its walls to legitimise any upstart empire. Consequently, seizing Rome before anyone else - especially those damnable Sicilian pirates - appears to be the most sensible course of action. Vae Victis!"

A couple of seconds of silence, then the Duke looked around the room and continued: "You are all simply shaking from the thought, right?" the snickering started again. "The thought of getting subjugated by the Polish army of halfwits and dullards! Ha!" The entire room burst into laughter, they laughed and laughed, the duke said one last thing to the diplomat before he sent him away: "Go home, son, stop embarassing yourself. Go on then!

 mva_wien_title:0 "Imperial Incursion"

 mva_lusatia_title:0 "Recover Lusatia" 
 mva_lusatia_desc:0 "The Sorbians were once the extent of our empire, but their refusal to convert and unrelated issues with Magyars led to them declaring independence.

 mva_tsar_desc:0 "The Roman Empire has been in a state of constant decline ever since the 6th century, internal strife, outside invasions, and a failed bureaucracy has resulted in the once mighty empire to collapse to a mere rump state centered around Constantiople.

The origin point of this spread is the legendary city of Kiev, though the city has fallen into a sad state since the Mongol Hordes sacked it.

 mva_wendish_crusade_title:0 "Wendish Crusade" 
 mva_wendish_crusade_desc:0 "The Pagan Wendish are the furthest west the Slavs have ever settled, but their refusal to see the true faith makes them a target to their neighbors.

 mva_glagolitic_desc:0 "The Glagolitic script was created by the brothers Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius in 863 to help spread the Orthodox faith in Moravia. While the use has changed over the years with conflict between Catholics and Orthodox, it still stands as the clerical script used in Moravia. By standardizing the script, we will eliminate any possibility of misinterpreting the holy scripture." 
 mva_zakon_title:0 "Zakon Sudnyi Liudem" 
 mva_zakon_desc:0 "The Court Law for the People is the oldest Slavic legal code, first copied from the Byzantine Ecloga law; it has spread throughout the Orthodox Slavic world as the main rule of law. But, it is severely outdated and needs updating. Thankfully, the printing press allows us to produce copies of the updated Zakon Sudnyi Liudem at a rapid rate and quickly spread them out throughout the land." 
 mva_universities_title:0 "Orthodox Colleges"

 mva_canonize_title:0 "Canonize Rostislav" 
 mva_canonize_desc:0 "Rostislav remains one of the most important figures in Moravian history, the first ruler to overthrow Frankish hegemony and the first to bring the light of Orthodoxy to the realm. His legacy was tarnished after the betrayal of his own nephew who imprisoned and left Rostislav to die in a Frankish prison to satiate his own lust for power. By canonizing Rostislav as a martyr for the Orthodox cause, we can create a unifying figure among the Orthodox Slavic world." 
 mva_religious_reforms_title:0 "Religious Reforms" 
 mva_religious_reforms_desc:0 "The Orthodox Church of Moravia has always been threatened by the Papists in the west and Pagans surrounding us from the east. The people of Moravia need guidance in these trying times. Churches must be constructed across the lands and all priests must be convened to solidify Orthodox teaching across the realm." 
 mva_patriarchate_title:0 "Moravian Patriarchate" 
 mva_patriarchate_desc:0 "Moravia has always been on the edge of the Orthodox world, cut off from the rest of it by the pagan Magyars; we relied more on local traditions instead of those in Greece.

 mva_seat_title:0 "The Royal Seat" 
 mva_seat_desc:0 "The center of the Moravia realm is the city of Veligrad, and while its grandeur has fallen off a bit since our golden age, it still has plenty of room to grow. By expanding districts, constructing monuments to legendary Slavic figures, investing into local businesses, establishing a functional sewage system, we can create a city to rival all of westerndom!" 
 mva_kremnica_title:0 "Golden Kremnica" 
 mva_kremnica_desc:0 "The gold mines of Kremnica have barely reached their peak potential, and we are missing out on a serious source of income. Mines must be expanded of course, but constructing a mint will allow us to mine the gold and mint out coinage at the same time. The wealth generated from this will of course go to the army, but maybe we could afford to siphon some of it to the average citizen." 
 mva_nitrava_title:0 "Fortress Nitrava" 
 mva_nitrava_desc:0 "The duchy of Nitrava has been our border state with the rotten Magyars for over 400 years, and we need to ensure they cannot reach the capital of Veligrad. The fortress of Nitrava needs to be expanded to create an impregnable fort that no army can ever take."

 naz_sword_islam_desc:0 "Since our humiliating defeat at Sidon, where the sultan Al-Husayn was brutally cut down by the treacherous infidel, we have been plotting our revenge. The crusader kings think themselves to be the shield of christianity. Let us martial the largest army in our Sultanate's history and prove once and for all that no shield may parry the sword of Islam!"
 naz_liberate_jerusalem_desc:0 "The primary goal of our war against the christians is to recapture the holy city of Jerusalem from which muslim pilgrims have been turned away for too long. We cannot delay our attack further, knowing the desecration that the holy monuments of the city have no doubt faced under the rule of the crusader scum."
 naz_purge_crusaders_desc:0 "The crusading nobility of the holy land must be rooted out from every castle they have built and every location which they have turned into one their blasphemous principalities. The settlers they brought with them are a different story. We could allow them to continue their worship in peace, knowing that they will not disturb our state, or send missionaries to supplicate them to Allah's light with a little...force."
 naz_seize_antioch_desc:0 "Antioch and Alexandretta are two of the world's most well-fortified cities. The citadel the crusaders have built at Antioch is undeniably impressive, but its walls will fall if their prince dares come to the aid of his cousins in Jerusalem when we attempt to retake the holy city once more."
 naz_conquer_cyprus_desc:0 "The crusader isle of Cyprus will prove difficult to occupy. The fortified island is notoriously difficult to invade; perhaps if we blockade the surrounding waters for long enough, we can stage a quick siege that will break their spirit enough for them to surrender."
 naz_purge_secure_desc:0 "We have wrought destruction upon the crusaders and uprooted them from the levant, but our merchants continue to complain of the harassment they face by the last catholic holdouts in the Aegean. The Knights of Rhodes are a naval nuisance that will be destroyed, just as their so-called 'brothers of the sword' were."
 naz_cilicia_desc:0 "The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia is a thorn in our side. Having been allowed to fester like a wound for far too long, the kingdom has become bold, aligning itself with other christian powers in the region. We cannot allow this foreign occupation of Tarsus to perpetuate any longer. We would sooner the damned Greeks rule over that land than its current overlords! Of course, we will be the ones ruling it soon enough."
 naz_follow_nile_desc:0 "The various kingdoms of Nubia seem to believe that we are unaware of their existence. They squabble amongst themselves as if we are not capable of destroying the whole of them in a single war. Now that we have the might, we should have a force martialed in upper Egypt to cross into Nubia and seize their lands - rich in ebony, ivory, and gold."
 naz_oases_desc:0 "Deep in the Egyptian desert, there are several oases, some already partially settled with tribal towns. They could be prime locations to develop to house our growing population. Alexandria should only have so many residents, after all."
 naz_copts_desc:0 "The Miaphysite Christians of Abyssinia are nothing like the crusaders. Many of them are amiable to our sultan, and they have made excellent advisors in the martial and administrative fields. It is not within our interest to suppress their culture, but rather to accept them as they are. Their well-disciplined Cawa warriors will be made officers in our army, as they fare better on the battlefield than many of our own native force."
 naz_nubia_desc:0 "The remainder of Nubia continues to elude us despite our conquest of the interior. In order to assert our control over the Red Sea and inland trade routes, we must secure Nubia in its entirety."
 naz_ethiopia_desc:0 "Having subjugated the Nubians to our rule, we are face to face with the highly-mythicized kingdom of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia, as its own inhabitants call it. The emperor of this state claims to be the last bastion of christianity in Africa, and to be in possession of the Ark of the Covenant. The unstoppable tide of Islam cannot be allowed to cease in the face of such arrogance. Ethiopia and all its riches shall be ours!"
 naz_indian_desc:0  "From the far east silk and spices, among other riches, are flowing into our lands. However, despite the volume of exchange that occurs with the kingdoms of India and the east, we know little about our lucrative trading partners. We should charter an expedition to these lands so that we may expand our opportunities."
 naz_seljuks_desc:0 "The Seljuk Turkish State continues to be a nuisance. Its decadent Sultan holes up in his harem, surrounded by sin and temptation, casually commanding his armies to amass at our border. Does he take the house of Nizzar for a joke? When Sivas is abluted by fire and our riders are at the gates of his extravagant palace, we shall have the last laugh!"
 naz_tradition_desc:0 "Among the Turks, those already converted to Islam are remarkably pious, though they know not the language of the prophet, nor the traditional islamic methods of administration. Under our rule, the same pashas will manage the Anatolian provinces as under the Seljuks, but they shall now write and speak in terms we can understand. This could be the beginning of a beautiful blending of cultures not dissimilar to the adoption of Arabic traditions by our Egyptian ancestors so long ago."
 naz_holy_cities_desc:0 "Makkah and Madinah are exposed to threat on all sides, from the ambitious desert tribes that currently rule over them to the many others that would wish to, as well as the christian powers of the African Horn and the heretics of Yemen. Naturally, since we already protect the Caliph, our Sultan should seize the two holy mosques so that they might be safe from desecration."
 naz_aden_desc:0 "Beyond the Hijaz is the most profitable stretch of land bordering the red sea; Yemen, with all its coffee fields and trading ports. If we can control the strait at the mouth of the Red Sea, known as the Gate of Grief, we can permanently monopolize trade in the Red Sea."
 naz_baghdad_desc:0 "Baghdad was once the city that the Abbasid Caliphs named as their capital. Now, after years of exchange between Arabs, Mongols, Turkoman tribes, and other various intermediary states, the round city is far from the global hub it once served as. In our possession, however, Baghdad would prosper as in eras past."
 naz_wisdom_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Baghdad was home to a combination library-university known as the House of Wisdom. Here, the great scholars of the Islamic world would gather to discuss natural philosophy, compose literature, and debate theology. This once great center of learning is now gone, but our status as patrons of art and science would be greatly elevated if we were to construct a new House of Wisdom, even grander than the original!"
 naz_extinguish_desc:0 "Persia remains an enigma. Despite centuries of incursion, no Muslim state has ever managed a campaign into the heart of Iran and remained intact long enough to integrate the region into Dar al-Islam. To change this, in the name of Nizzar, we shall embark upon a journey of conquest that will mirror that of Iskandar himself, sweeping into Persia with a force never before seen!"
 naz_iran_desc:0 "What is Iran now, but a plateau populated by the same arrogant heathens that Iskandar himself once subjugated in the Hellenic age? It is the destiny of the House of Nizzar to put the entire region to the sword, and prove once and for all that the unrelenting tide of Islam is truly unstoppable!"
 naz_khorasan_desc:0 "The natural extension of our conquest in Iran is the subjugation of Khorasan, whose multiethnic polities are divided between nomadic and settled people, all of whom will make easy targets for our forces as we secure the logical borders of our empire."
 naz_anatolian_desc:0 "With the Seljuks defeated, it follows that we should take advantage of the Anatolian power vacuum by bringing the various remaining Turkish states into the fold, along with the Greek kingdom of Nicaea, the last holdout of that culture on the anatolian peninsula."
 naz_presence_in_india_desc:0 "How insulting it was for our sailors to arrive in an Indian port they frequented, only to find that the dock and adjacent town were adorned with the banner of the Caliph of Cordoba! They reported that the port had not been conquered; rather, its trading rights were purchased by the Caliph. How dare other powers encroach on the Indian ocean trade from which we are the primary beneficiary! We must buy our own port, and fast!"
 naz_constantinople_desc:0 "Constantinople, known as the City of the World's Desire, is not necessarily reflective of its epithet anymore. Although it has been eclipsed in grandeur by various cities throughout the world, the Bosphorus Strait remains a critical chokepoint for our naval and trading operations in the mediterranean. Surely the Osmanoglu trading family will appreciate a more theologically sympathetic overlord."
 naz_caucasian_desc:0 "The Christian Kingdom of Georgia is not necessarily a threat, but securing the strategic Caucasus mountain range within our borders could prove to be an advantageous defense against the hordes beyond the peaks."
 naz_persia_desc:0 "The Sassanids, similarly to the Romans, boast that they are the last bastion of an empire that, in some shape or form, has lasted two thousand years. The time has come to show these arrogant fools that no flame can protect them. The Shahanshah should know by now that his ancient cataphract tactics are showing their age."
 naz_fareast_desc:0 "The further reaches of the Indian Ocean are home to the mysterious spice islands. From these rich and densely jungled lands flow some of the most desired spices and materials in the world. With just one city in the region in our control, we can funnel riches untold into our homeland!"
 naz_spice_desc:0 "It has become clear that the merchants of Indonesia are far too tough a sell for us to continue trading with. It would be much easier to use our overwhelming military might to wrest control of the spice trade."
 naz_trade_hegemony_desc:0 "We are within a hair's breadth of total east-west trade hegemony, in both the indian ocean and over the silk road. If we can just maintain a hold over the strait of Malacca, the gateway to China, no other power will dare contest our merchants."
 naz_african_expedition_desc:0 "Beyond Benghazi lie the open deserts of the Maghreb, a wild land of pirates and tribes whose pacification is a primary concern of the coastal egyptians who are subject to constant raids at the hands of these brutes. With a small army, we should take control of some areas of the vast Maghrebi Desert as a preliminary act before committing to more aggressive operations."
 naz_tunis_desc:0 "The barbary pirates of Tunis are perhaps the greatest threat to our interests in the mediterranean. To put a permanent end to their hostility, we shall slaughter them where they stand and strike at the heart of the tunisian sultanate that permits them to raid us!"
 naz_sicily_desc:0 "Having stemmed from the Tunisians, the Sicilian sultanate is a piratical threat that we anticipated. This, however, doesn't mean that their actions are acceptable. Just like their unruly cousin to the south, the heretical Tunisian Sultan shall face retribution for his constant incursions into our waters."
 naz_maghreb_desc:0 "With the pirates of the central Mediterranean eradicated, we find our borders enticingly extended deep into the Maghreb. Perhaps conquering deeper into the region could be advantageous in combating further piracy and disrupting the interests of our greatest rivals, the Andalusian Caliphate of Cordoba."
 naz_andalusia_desc:0 "The Maghreb is now fully under the control of our state, and across the pillars of Hercules, the Andalusian garrison at Jabal-Tariq practically taunts us! With friction building up at the gate of the Mediterranean, the so-called Caliph in Cordoba must know what comes next. We shall launch an all-out assault, defeating our rival once and for all, dethroning the illegitimate Caliph and uniting Dar al-Islam under one banner!"
 naz_caliphate_desc:0 "With all other pretenders deposed, the Sultan is faced with a dilemma regarding the succession of the Caliphate. The Abbasid puppet we have paraded around our realm for so long now seems more like a humorous showman when compared to our mighty Sultan. For this reason, it only follows that we should allow the 'Caliph' to retire to an estate where he can live out his days, having been relieved of his ceremonial duties. The title of Caliph will be transferred to the Nizzarid Sultan, uniting the secular and religious leadership of our realm."
 naz_dockyard_desc:0 "From Venetian smugglers and zealous naval Knights to Barbary Pirates and every maritime threat in between, our Mediterranean waters face constant threat. To protect our coastline, we must construct a grand fleet, and to do so, we must create a grand dockyard in the capital. From there, we will launch a thousand ships and more so that we are no longer navally challenged."
 naz_sponsor_desc:0 "Perhaps our conquest of North Africa has been too harsh. The Barbary Pirates of the region are not so nationalistic that they would turn down a good opportunity. Despite our brutal subjugation of their homeland, many of their bands are willing to sail under a different black banner, our very own. With these raiders now loyal to us, we will be able to share in the loot of the Mediterranean's great cities."
 naz_reform_cavalry_desc:0 "The shock cavalry that Nizzar utilized to dethrone the Ayyubids centuries ago remains the core of our armies. These noble cataphracts are drafted from the highest strata of our society and their discipline and valor is unmatched by any European knight. To ensure that the prevalence of firearms on modern battlefields does not render our cavalry irrelevant, we must reform the units and train them in the usage of firearms, as well as in new tactics that will allow them to disrupt and disarm modern infantry formations."
 naz_empower_stratocracy_desc:0 "The most senior administrators of our state are the Sultan's loyal generals, among whose ranks are the most seasoned and innovative military men in Dar al-Islam, nay, the world. Without their leadership, our Sultan must admit, he would be nobody at all. To ensure their future loyalty, we will promote them to official governmental positions beyond the military, altering our state so that it may better serve our army, rather than vice versa."
 naz_nizzar_academy_desc:0 "Nizzar the Great was known for the unmatched discipline of his fighters. It is said that he personally trained his men, performing strength training and combat drills alongside them, not unlike his greatest inspiration, al-Iskandar al-Akbar. To continue the legacy of the discipline in which our state was forged, the Sultan should order the construction of a grand military academy in the capital, which will both honor his forefather and serve as a training ground for thousands of future conscripts and volunteers."
 naz_military_infrastructure_desc:0 "The army that powers our Sultanate requires men to sustain its size. The casualties of war and retirement of veterans periodically result in manpower shortages. To rectify this, we should construct military training fields throughout the realm, along with free housing in barracks for any who volunteer into our service. Surely this will ensure a steady flow of fresh blood for our growing war machine."
 naz_islam_sword_desc:0 "Without our presence, the chroniclers tell us, the safety of the Islamic world would not be nearly as secured as it is now. The increasing confidence of our subjects and those abroad in our ability to defend the faithful from harm and launch incursions into heathen territory has imbued our soldiers with unprecedented levels of morale. United, they are truly fit to be called the Sword of Islam!"
 naz_protect_hajj_desc:0 "Our state is steadily growing to encompass an increasingly more vast swath of the Islamic world. For this reason, we must ensure that our road system is protected and developed so that the faithful may travel from far and wide to Mecca to complete their Hajj."
 naz_alexandria_desc:0 "Alexandria is one of the grandest cities in the world already, but to challenge the power of the European states and prove our status to other Muslim powers, we must make sure that it is a metropolis on par with its own classical iteration, home to untold riches and the greatest monuments to be seen anywhere."
 naz_library_desc:0 "In the Hellenistic period, after Iskandar's conquest of Egypt, a massive library was constructed in Alexandria which housed the world's largest collection of books, scrolls, and other recorded knowledge. Sadly, this palace of learning was destroyed sometime during Roman Rule in Egypt. To reverse the barbarous actions of its destroyers, we must erect a new library and invite scholars from across the world to contribute works new and old to populate its shelves."
 naz_advisor_desc:0 "No state can function without effective administrators. Accordingly, our Sultan must surround himself with trustworthy and intelligent advisors, loyal enough not to plot his downfall, but independent enough to challenge the Sultan when he is wrong, so that he may be a just and disciplined ruler."
 naz_suez_desc:0 "Since time Immemorial, the Levant and Africa have been united only by an infinitesimal stretch of land between Egypt and the Sinai peninsula. Our engineers and sailors have recently suggested that modern technology is advanced enough to create a grand canal that will connect the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, reducing travel distance by thousands of miles. Imagine the profit that could be generated not just by the trade that would flow through this canal, but also by taxing foreign fleets seeking to pass through the new tollgate of world trade! We must immediately begin construction!"
 naz_trade_desc:0 "Despite all the profit there is to seek in India, the Far East, and Africa, there truly is no place like home. The loyal merchants of Syria and Egypt maintain a millennia-old exchange based around grain and cotton that continues to this day. We should capitalize on the volume of trade within the homeland."
 naz_delta_desc:0 "The Nile Delta is home to grain fields that fed the entire Mediterranean and beyond at the Roman Empire's height. We are certain that with enough expansion of the existing irrigation systems, we will be able to recreate the fields that once earned the Nile Delta the title of Breadbasket."
 naz_textile_desc:0 "The conversion of raw silk and cloth from the east into textiles and clothing is fast becoming one of the most profitable industries in the world. We should take advantage of the vast supply of raw cotton and silk we produce and import to manufacture textiles that can be sold to Europe at extravagant prices."
 naz_industrialize_desc:0 "Across the world, the fires of industry are roaring, and we will not be left behind. The massive grain, textile, and mining industries we already facilitate must be modernized and expanded. We will charter state corporations to oversee the creation of new factories across the Sultanate so that we may continue to have a dominant and competitive economy, not reliant on anyone else's imports."
 naz_granary_desc:0 "In the Nile Delta, we already produce some of the highest yields of grain in the world, but with modern irrigation and advancements in agricultural technology, we can expand the fields to produce more grain in less time and with less human labor. We will flood foreign markets with such high volumes of grain that they will find it pointless to grow their own, making the Nile Delta the granary of the entire world and giving the Sultanate powerful leverage in future trade deals."

 swa_habsburgs_title:0 "Defeat the Habsburgs"

 swa_romandie_title:0 "Conquer Romandie"
 swa_romandie_desc:0 "Romandie, the non-Germanic part of Switzerland, is a rich province that places us in a strategical location that will prove useful for us for future expansions into either Gaul or Italia. Therefore we must conquer it from the Swiss, who are unable to protect it themselves anyways."
 swa_invade_switzerland_title:0 "Invade Switzerland"
 swa_invade_switzerland_desc:0 "Switzerland is a weak league of autonomous cantons who call themselves a nation, this republic is must be brought under Swabian fold, for we can defend the Swiss better from Lombardy and other powerful Italian princes better than themselves.

However, our way of life as nomadic reindeer herders does not work with modern borders used by other nations, since lands used by herders for centuries may look like an uninhabited wasteland to most outsiders. This why the lands like that of Kainuu, which is mostly inhabited by Sami people that practice their religion, is claimed by a foreign power who will seek to erase their culture to make way for their own. We need to reconquer this land and liberate our people from their foreign masters. With this first step, we will traverse the road to reclaiming the lands of the Sami people and safeguard our way of living."

Diverting a large number of resources into developing our capital will greatly benefit us administrative, economically, and militarily. A larger capital will also give us the benefit of projecting our power abroad, showing our warmongering neighbors of Sweden and Norway that we are the rulers of the far north and not a people they can simply conquer."
 smi_trade_desc:0 "Wealth is the lifeblood of kingdoms and trade is the most profitable source of wealth. During our many interactions with our southern neighbors, the most peaceful once have been during the trade of reindeer furs, something we have in large supply. The only problem with our fur trade is the market that is available to us. Due to our geographical location, the Baltic sea is our only source of maritime trade, with the White sea being frozen over most of the year and its coast being scarcely populated. To increase the wealth of our realm, we need to expand our trade influence in the baltic sea, by whatever means necessary."

Normandy has a long history of Scandinavian raids and colonisations. The name itself comes from the Latin word Nortmanni which means "men of the North". Utilizing the same strategy we used when we conquered the British Isles, we will conquer Normandy to have a stable position for attacking the rest of Europe.

 nor_ulster_desc:0 "The island of Ireland consists of multiple kingdoms and earldoms which constantly fight and undermine each other. The only reason these tumultuous lands haven't been conquered is due to the island rather remote location to the rest of Europe. If any foreign power wishes to conquer Ireland they need a big navy and an ambition to conquer even the most remote locations. Luckily for us, we fit both descriptions.

It's then that the true conflict for Scandinavia will begin and we must be prepared for it.

 nor_eastcoast_title:0 "Colonize East Coast"
 nor_eastcoast_desc:0 "The history of Norway has always consisted of the quest for greener pastures. It's the reason our ancestors took to the sea to raid others, it's the reason we went to war with English kings and it's the reason we decided to sail into the unknown to find the legendary Vinland. Now we have found it and it's even better than the legends promised. Explorers report that to the south of what our ancestors named Vinland lies large sways of green land that is mostly unpopulated. If we were to send strong men and their families to colonize these fresh lands we could feed the entirety of Norway several times over.

 fkn_bavaria_title:0 "Control Bavaria"

 ned_imperial_desc:0 "Located at the periphery of Europe and separated from the Emperor by the Hohenstaufens, the Low Countries have never had a strong connection to the rest of their peers in the Holy Roman Empire. This unfortunate state of affairs must change if we are to grow stronger."
 ned_lowlands_title:0 "Unite the Lowlands"
 ned_lowlands_desc:0 "The Lowlands have been disunited for centuries, oftentimes subjugated under a foreign empire. We must ensure this never happens again, to us or to our bretheren in other lands: if we can unify the squabbling princes of the region, we will be a formidable force and counterweight to the great empires of Europe."
 ned_wallonia_title:0 "Conquer Wallonia"
 ned_wallonia_desc:0 "Wallonia is not a region that has had particular importance for us in the past, being French speaking and culturally different from our main territories. However, it is a rich land, with wealthy cities and a large population: it would be a fantastic addition to our nation."
 ned_united_title:0 "The United Netherlands"
 ned_united_desc:0 "If all of the Low Countries can be brought under our rule, a unique Netherlandish identity can be developed. Not solely Dutch, French, or German, the United Netherlands will be a beacon of prosperity and unity in Europe."
 ned_calais_title:0 "Port of Calais"
 ned_calais_desc:0 "The port city of Calais is located in a strategic location for trade with England and the wider world. Goods from as far away as North Africa and Russia arrive at its shores, and thus represents a trade hub of a size unmatched in Western Europe. We must secure it, for the glory and good of the Koninklijke Marine!"
 ned_drain_title:0 "Drain the Wetlands"
 ned_drain_desc: "The fenland and marshes of the Netherland do not suit themselves to prolonged economic development on such a large scale. We must construct levees and dikes to stabilise the rivers, and undergo a great project to remove water from the floodplains: only then will the true riches of the Netherlands be shown to the world."
 ned_canals_title:0 "The Canal System"
 ned_canals_desc:0 "Our cities have grown significantly over the past decades, and the current infrastructure is struggling to accommodate the new populace. A system mostly relying on the construction of canals connecting the Zuiderzee to various rivers has been devised to allow for further expansion: following this route will lead to great affluence in our lands."
 ned_capital_title:0 "Expand the Capital"
 ned_capital_desc:0 "Our great capital [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] requires growth in order to sustain our rapidly expanding nation. We must expand infrastructure and develop a planned city to serve as a thriving hub for our conquests."
 ned_expand_title:0 "Economic Development"
 ned_expand_desc:0 "The Netherlands are not a large nation, especially compared to our rivals in the west or across the Channel. To compensate for this diminutive size, we must heavily invest in creating a prosperous nation with a booming economy, as to remain competitive with possible foes."
 ned_textile_title:0 "Textile Industry"
 ned_textile_desc:0 "Raw wool from England and Spain makes its way to our shores, where it is then processed and made into cloth. Our clothmakers have been renowned for their skill and expertise for centuries, and thus this trade has potential to become a major source of income to the state, if it is capitalised upon."
 ned_diamonds_title:0 "The Diamond Capital"
 ned_diamonds_desc:0 "In the past few decades, Amsterdam has grown into a significant gemstone working hub, mostly due to immigrating Jews arriving into our lands seeking shelter. This diamond cutting business is largely unrecognised in the rest of Europe, despite the profit it brings: by encouraging its production and incentivising new workers to take up the profession, Amsterdam may yet become known across the world as the City of Diamonds."
 ned_garrison_title:0 "Fixed Garrisons"
 ned_garrison_desc:0 "The garrisons in our cities are oftentimes neglected and reduced in size during peacetime, only to be hastily restaffed in times of conflict. This leads to unfortunate circumstances where garrisons cannot be replenished in time, with possibly disastrous consequences. Let us institute a system of permanent garrisons, and make our nation into an impenetrable wall."
 ned_amsterdam_title:0 "Port of Amsterdam"
 ned_amsterdam_desc:0 "The great Port of Amsterdam has grown into a trading location of considerable size in the past centuries. Despite this fact, there are still areas that have more trade volume than Amsterdam does, reflecting negatively on our income: the Port must be expanded, and our trades in Europe must grow ever larger."
 ned_college_title:0 "Admiralty Colleges"

 ned_beggars_title:0 "Sea Beggars"
 ned_beggars_desc:0 "Watergeuzen, known as Sea Beggars in English, are powerful and determined privateers that are skilled at blockading cities. Having them on our side will help bolster our navy and give us an extra edge over our opponents."
 ned_city_council_title:0 "Strengthen the City Councils"
 ned_city_council_desc:0 "The City Councils in the Netherlands are often weak and inefficient at doing their jobs, said jobs being administration and taxation of our cities. We must strengthen their permissions and their abilities to maximise the production and power found in our small nation."
 ned_generality_title:0 "Generality Lands"
 ned_generality_desc:0 "It is important to administer our country fairly, never favoring one province over another too much. To that end, the central government sometimes needs to directly administer lands to prevent one regional faction from gaining too much influence in national affairs."
 ned_reformation_title:0 "Answer the Reformation"
 ned_reformation_desc:0 "The Reformation has swept across Europe like a scythe through grain, and religious conflict has sparked throughout the continent. We must either accept or renounce the Reformation: one way or another, we cannot remain neutral in this time of troubles."
 ned_stadt_title:0 "Merge the Stadtholders"
 ned_stadt_desc:0 "Nominally, every province within the Netherlands has a Stadtholder, who holds executive power over their domain. In practice, however, a stadtholder rules many provinces, and several have ruled a majority of provinces in the Republic, where the bureaucratic system adds inefficiency. We must merge the stadtholders of the provinces into one office, a Stadtholder-General."
 ned_contract_title:0 "Regent's Contracts"
 ned_contract_desc:0 "The regents are a particular class of provincial patricians, the leaders of city councils and the wise men who fill the ranks of national committees. Among themselves, there are flashes of partisanship, driven by dynastic ambitions, personal grievances, and rarely some genuine ideological differences. Since these people are our chief administrators and responsible for the governance of our cities, it is in the government's interest to lessen the tensions between regents. One of the more straightforward solutions is to encourage contracts between regents, where they agree to alternate control of a political office between them. That way, even if one family doesn't like another family in power, they know that their turn in power will come soon if they just wait."
 ned_general_reglement_title:0 "Issue General Reglement"
 ned_general_reglement_desc:0 "The myriad provincial laws of our lands provide countless opportunities for abuse and corruption. General laws which apply consistently to every province in the land may conflict with the traditional rights of the states, but they will go a long way towards providing efficient and honest government for all our people."

 ned_channel_title:0 "Secure the Channel"
 ned_channel_desc:0 "The English Channel is one of the wealthiest and busiest waterways on Earth. Unfortunately, much of the trade and subsequent income do not end up in our ports, and instead seek to buy and sell elsewhere. This must change if we are to grow into a genuine European power."

 ned_austrlaia_discover_desc:0 "Our contacts in the Indies speak of a land to their south, full of strange creatures like giant rats with pouches, and a beaver with the beak of a duck. Even if the lands aren't rich in resources, this is something we have to see for ourselves."
 ned_indies_title:0 "Dutch East Indies"
 ned_indies_desc:0 "Our trade in the Indies flourishes, but the security of our commerce and our merchants is in jeopardy as long as our economic control of the region isn't matched by political control.

 ned_japan_desc:0 "There are several small islands in Japan around the major trading port of Nagasaki.

 ned_charter_voc_title:0 "Charter the East Indies"

It was the largest organized effort by the vikings ever committed and had the most lasting impact, especially in British Isles as our Danish cousins successfully conquered the Four English Kingdoms. The Danes, however, have disappointed the vikings. They failed to upkeep their conquests in England and the Great Heathen Army has stopped existing, forever to be left in the pages of history as a shameful failure. The Danes have shown their weakness, being defeated by the peace-loving Christ-loving weaklings...\n\n But that does not mean that the time of Viking is over.\nBang the drums,\nBlow the horns,\nRouse the pillagers.\n The Great Heathen Army will be brought back under Norwegian rule, stronger than ever before with a clear purpose - War."

The Berserkir tradition is a powerful one in Viking culture, one we have not really utilized too well as only key few strangers utilzied it. Perhaps it would be a smart decision to utilize the Berserkirs and create a proper strikeforce of them that shall be attached to our armies with the purpose of shocking our foes."

The Dark Legend of Stamford tells a story about a viking king from the north named Harald Hardrada who was given the claim to the Kingdom of England. Though Harald was accursed by Christendom he still lived his life like a viking. He was Norway's first chance at staking its claim at Conquest of England reminiscient of Danes' own and bring back the Danelaw. The accursed bridge of Stamford, however, deemed him unworthy as the Norwegian forces were pushed back... \n\n But 400 years have passed, and with it times has changed. The salted wounds have been licked clean and locked shut. It was time for revenge. It was time to avenge the shameful defeat. It was time to conquer England afresh."

The viking rule in Russia was shortlived, however, as similarly one by one his descendants fell to the corruptive influence of Slavic faith and culture. As if that was not enough the Slavs and slavified Descendants of Mighty Rurik fell to the seduction of Christendom, never to see Valhalla.\n\nThe times have changed. The Vikings are making a comeback, with a breath of fresh air blown to our lungs, and with it we have a renewed thrill towards achieving glorious battle.

Of course, the city would be badly damaged by the planned siege, he thought that was most obvious, but decided not to pester the Caliph about what may happen to the city he is daydreaming about. "Do you understand, my friend? This city is the capital of the oldest existing empire! If we succeed, the entire world, and maybe even Allah himself, will sing our names for centuries to come! This wi-", the advisor interrupted him "Yes, your Majesty, I understand. But you must decide what to do with the city afterward. Its walls won't hold for long and the army WILL want payment after such a long siege". "Are you suggesting that I sack the "City of the World's Desire"?!"  -  the Caliph was angered by such a suggestion  -  "There are hundreds, if not thousands even, years of history and knowledge kept in those walls, the Theodosian Walls, might I say. No, I will not sack it! The World will think of us as savages if we dare do such a thing!", he stopped for a bit to think. "Listen to me, Your Ma-", this time the advisor was cut off  -  "Enough! Go to your tent, Shura. I will see you with the other advisors at dawn.". "Very well...", answered the advisor, who didn't want to anger him further, "Good night, sir."  -  the Caliph did not respond, he was looking out into the bay, into the Golden Horn - the chain that was blocking his navy from blockading the city efficiently, he pondered on what to do about it.

Unfortunately, the City does not reflect the importance it plays, lacking much-needed development and infrastructure that a modern capital needs. The greatness of an empire reflects in the greatness of its capital and if we are to claim the title of a Wendish Empire, we must ensure that our capital is capable of housing the vast amount of people that will need to visit the city and make sure that our architecture properly reflects the greatness of our empire.

While trade is profitable, we are still at the mercy of German and Bohemian traders who can direct trade away or simply ignore us to weaken our economy. To challenge this stranglehold we must challenge these traders by seizing their markets for ourselves and putting them under embargoes of our own.

 qqt_silkroad_desc:0 "The Silk Road has deteriorated significantly since the collapse of the Mongol Empire, destroying much of the economic and cultural transfer between China and Europe.

 qqt_cities_title:0 "The Trading Centers"

 qqt_spread_title:0 "Spread the Faith"

 qqt_patriarch_title:0 "Patriarch of the East"
 qqt_patriarch_desc:0 "The Catholicoi, or Patriarchs of the Church of the East, are the head bishops and leaders of the Nestorian Church. As the preeminent Nestorian power, we shall embrace the Patriarchate and enthrone a Khitan leader!"
 qqt_temples_title:0 "Expand the Church"
 qqt_temples_desc:0 "How can we rule our people if we lack the people capable of guiding their souls and be their moral guides? We need to expand the church. There is not enough priests dedicated to shepherd our newly converted peoples. New churches and new priests need to be built and trained respectively to ensure the spiritual integrity of our realm."
 qqt_income_title:0 "Revitalize the Economy"
 qqt_income_desc:0 "Apart from our horses and warriors, the steppes do not have much to offer. However, the trade routes from China to Europe pass through our kingdom. We could then increase our income by taxing the goods passing through and by improving our trade facilities. "
 qqt_throne_title:0 "Claim the Dragon Throne"
 qqt_throne_desc:0 "We have reclaimed our title as Liao, but the dragon throne is still out of our reach. If we are to fully legitimize ourselves as the second coming of Liao we need to reclaim the mandate."
 qqt_reform_title:0 "The Celestial Empire"
 qqt_reform_desc:0 "Each new Dynasty had a tendency to change how China is ruled, and it is only reasonable if we brought forth our own changes to how the Chinese ought to be ruled. We are the first Dynasty to return, and we are the first Christian Dynasty China has seen. We are a Christened Phoenix rising from the ashes of idolatry. Similarly the Celestial Empire that we have reclaimed ought to be baptized and reformed to fit the new state we are in."
 qqt_tribuatries_title:0 "Establish the Tributaries"
 qqt_tribuataries_desc:0 "Long ago, our powerful kingdom could rely on its many tributaries to overwhelm us with gold and men. However, with our decline they all decided to switch allegiance or declare their independence. Now that we have regained power, we must re-establish the system that was so beneficial to us. "  
 qqt_government_title:0 "Reform the Government"
 qqt_government_desc:0 "As an old kingdom, our country is mired in traditions that prevent us from governing effectively. Although they are a guarantee of stability, it is time to reform our institutions if we want our kingdom to regain its former splendour. "
 qqt_tibet_title:0 "Conquer Tibet"
 qqt_tibet_desc:0 "The mountainous region of Tibet might at first sight seem irrelevant to us. However, faith and spirituality are very strong there and governing such a holy region would only give us more legitimacy. Moreover, we are told that the lands beyond the mountains are prosperous and only await our merchants. "
 qqt_kashmir_title:0 "Control Kashmir"
 qqt_kashmir_desc:0 "Kashmir is a contested region as it is the main gateway to India. Situated at the crossroads of many trade routes, its position makes the region culturally very diverse and traders from all over the continent meet there. It is therefore a highly strategic point to control and we cannot leave it in the hands of our enemies. "
 qqt_central_title:0 "Into Central Asia"
 qqt_central_desc:0 "At our peak, we controlled everything from Liaoning to Transoxiana. Our empire is now long gone but we are ready to reclaim it mile by mile. The western kingdoms have long been weakened by internal crises and endless wars. It is time for us to conquer again the lands that have been stolen from us. "
 qqt_christianize_title:0 "Christianize China"
 qqt_christianize_desc:0 "Idolworshippers, unbelievers, apathetic occultists and Crypto-Satanists are but a few words we can use to describe all of Chinese population. They are morally bankcrupt, but that does not mean they should remain that way, no. Instead we should help guide them toa better future. A future thought unimaginable... A Christian Future."
 qqt_north_china_title:0 "Claim North China"
 qqt_north_china_desc:0 "North China is a land our ancestors used to rule over. It is only just if our old lands were to return under our complete rule."
 qqt_house_title:0 "Control the House of Cards"
 qqt_house_desc:0 "The empire, long divided, must unite; long united must divide. Thus, it has ever been. Many dynasties have believed that China was under their control, they have all disappeared. Instability is never far away and at any moment a crisis can turn into a civil war that can dethrone those in power. We have learned this hard lesson once and we are now ready. China for too long has been divided... "
 qqt_rebuild_capital_title:0 "Rebuild Shangjing"
 qqt_rebuild_capital_desc:0 "During the Liao Dynasty, the first emperor, Taizu, built what would become his main capital. After we lost control of North China, Shangjing fell into ruin and oblivion. Now that we are again in control of the region, we should proclaim the restoration of the city as a symbol of the rebirth of the Khitan Empire. "
 qqt_admin_title:0 "New Administration"
 qqt_admin_desc:0 "Times are changing, and with them Liao should. We can't forever rely on tradition and need to make way for new traditions to emerge. If we allow ourselves to adapt we need to first reshape the very top of our society - administration."
 qqt_rebirth_title:0 "Cultural Rebirth"
 qqt_rebirth_desc:0 "Our culture was on the brink of extinction, forced to exist in the far reaches of China in the harsh steppes surrounded by turkic tribes. In centuries to come we managed to survive and even turn the tide of our culture's fate by returning to the top of China. However, our culture is endangered right now. If we are to ensure its survival for centuries to come we ought to actively support it everyway possible and in select cases even spread it upon our subjects. Only way to ensure our cultural rebirth is to make kindling out of other cultures in China."

 yuan_china_modernize_print_desc:0 "Printing was a revolution, but that was ages ago. It is time for us to modernize this technology.

 yua_china_taiwan_desc:0 "The island of Taiwan, despite its closeness to China, has never been populated by anyone civilized. The indigenous tribes there are small in number and the land seems ripe for settement. Perhaps we can encourage some of our subjects to migrate."
 yua_china_expedition_desc:0 "Our explorers know there are numerous unsettled islands in and beyond the southern sea. This untamed land seems perfect for settlement by those citizens of our empire wishing for a new life away from the dense cities and vast farmlands of China."
 yua_china_moluccas_desc:0 "The Moluccas, though similarly rich in spices and other goods to the more famous "spice islands" in malacca, are largely unexploited and not as competed over by local kingdoms. Perhaps we should found a few settlements to test the trade waters."

 yuan_china_hermit_desc:0 "We have heard that other powers have taken to calling us the 'hermit kingdom'. While intended to be a perjorative, we take no shame in this title.

 yuan_china_metropolis_desc:0 "In the past, the farmer and tax collector held up the economy of the nation. No longer.

By bolstering these already established cities, we can ensure continuous prosperity."

 yua_china_naval_silk_road_desc:0 "Silk has always been the most profitable export from China, especially to european merchants. For ages untold, the harsh land route through central Asia and Persia was the premier way to transport silk and other goods to Europe from China. With our control over sea routes and grand navy, we can create a safer and more navigable silk road over the ocean."
 yua_china_unknown_desc:0 "The land that Europeans call 'the New World', has been discovered to be more easily reachable by us than previously known. Should we create settlements in this mysterious land, perhaps we could beat the Europeans at their own game."
 yua_rival_europe_desc:0 "While European nations, with their colonies and squabbles, love to refer to themselves as the 'great powers of the world', they live in ignorance of the true Power, the middle kingdom. Perhaps it is time to outdo them once and for all, even if it means engaging in their petty rivalry games."

 id_protect_title:0 "Maritime Trade Protection" 
 id_protect_desc:0 "As we gain more access to the sea, we secure the trade that comes along with it. Alas, pirates go hand in hand with such lucrative maritime commerce, often preying upon our fledgling merchant flotillas.

 dai_north_desc:0 "When the Mongols invaded Japan and claimed Kyoto, the country was divided in two. While the South naturally recognised the authority of the new Shogun as prescribed by the ancestral laws, the Daimyos of the North refused to pledge allegiance and declared their independence.

We are now left to our own devices to safeguard our dynasty’s interests in Japan. We must rein in the clans which gained too much autonomy, and who seek to advance their own power."
 tjj_integrate_title:0 "Integrate the Daimyo"

 tjj_naval_title:0 "Construct a Fleet"
 tjj_naval_desc:0 "Before the Mongol invasion, Japan was already a local naval power, even though some of them were pirates. With our increasingly independent efforts to rule in Japan, we should construct a new fleet.

 tjj_protect_title:0 "Protect the Naval Trade"
 tjj_protect_desc:0 "Naval trade is an important source of income for us, and with our recent efforts in fleet construction, we can protect our maritime trade more effectively. However, we must endeavour to further make sure that no privateers dare threaten us, and so our traders will continue to ensure Japanese interests in regional trade centers."
 tjj_ghost_title:0 "The Ghost of Tsushima"
 tjj_ghost_desc:0 "Tsushima was one of the first places the first waves of the Mongol invasion struck in their conquest of Japan. We encountered heavy resistance from the clans there, and even to this day, some remaining guerilla fighters are still resisting our rule. We must construct forts, and improve local infrastructure, to increase the effectiveness of the pro-shogunate militia and deal with the guerilla fighters."

 tjj_tradition_desc:0 "Despite ruling over Japan for over a century, we cannot forget our Mongol roots. Deep down the ruling class is still Mongol, and the traditions of our forefathers flow through our blood.

There will be a time where it shall come to our aid once more."

 tjj_north_title:0 "Subjugate the Eastern Clans"
 tjj_north_desc:0 "There are certain parts of Eastern Japan never touched by the Mongols, for a multitude of reasons, and unfortunately limiting the Shogun’s rule in some areas.

 tjj_expand_north_title:0 "The Northern Campaign"
 tjj_expand_north_desc:0 "Although the Mongol invasion was successful, it ultimately failed to bring all of Japan under the authority of the Mongol Shogun.

 tjj_warlords_title:0 "Control the Warlords"
 tjj_warlords_desc:0 "China below the Yellow River is in a state of constant flux, suffering from rampant warlordism and fighting. Thusfar, no side has truly managed to defeat another, before being defeated and replaced by another rising power. These warlords, no better than bandit-kings, are weak and disunited; it shall be easy to manipulate and subjugate as we please."
 tjj_subjects_title:0 "Subjugate the Chinese"
 tjj_subjects_desc:0 "The Southern Chinese warlords are unruly, and would make a direct occupation of the south untenable.

 tjj_zaibatsu_desc:0 "As our economy continues to grow, the merchant class has inevitably found itself in a position of wealth and power. Although officially at the bottom of the caste system, it is hard to look down on ones so adept at seeking and creating wealth. We must actively support them, and found mercantile conglomerates, or 'Zaibatsu', to help our economy prosper."
 tjj_construct_the_gokaido_title:0 "Construct the Gokaido"
 tjj_construct_the_gokaido_desc:0 "Although our domestic opponents have been subdued, it is important that we continue to keep these lords in check.

 tjj_permit_ryogaesho_desc:0 "Many daimyo have suffered from erratic finances, causing some to default on loans they foolishly took in moments of desperation. Enabling smaller money change shops to offer more reliable loans, and to back up those loans with our own reserves, should help stabilise daimyo finances. As an added bonus, this may perhaps foster a healthier domestic economy."

 tjj_five_routes_title:0 "Improve the Gokaido"
 tjj_five_routes_desc:0 "The Gokaido roads and stations have heavily increased our troops' speed across Japan, but there is still much to be done. If we are to make the Gokaido into a true unifying pathway, connecting all parts of our domain, it is vital to maintain and overhaul the pathways to account for increased usage by horsedrawn vehicles. This will ensure that we can easily and quickly respond to any threat to us from overseas, with the added benefit of being able to crush any revolts within our lands without giving them time to organise."
 tjj_survey_the_secret_fields_title:0 "Prevent Secret Fields"
 tjj_survey_the_secret_fields_desc:0 "It is embarrassingly common in the provinces for farmers to maintain so-called 'secret fields'; farmland hidden from the eyes of tax collectors. A thorough accounting of these unreported properties should significantly bolster our coffers."

 tjj_argiculture_desc:0 "Our agricultural practices have remained static for millennia. Today's farmer tends to their rice fields in the same manner as their father, as did their grandfather, going back to the reign of the first emperor.

 tcr_war_title:0 "The Three Kingdoms"
 tcr_war_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Chagatai Khanate, the Tarim Basin has been home to the three major Tocharian Kingdoms; Shule, Kuci, and Kroriana. Each has been ravaged and ruined by the various empires that have pushed into the Basin from the Han to the Mongols. Each one continues to vie for power against the others, often sending raiding parties and small excursions to test the might of their rivals.

 tcr_khitan_desc:0 "While the Khitan were instrumental in the Chagatai Revolt that brought us out of the Mongol’s Shadow, they have since proved as tyrannical as the hordes before them. Demanding tribute and forcing their influence over our kingdoms, trying to keep the basin weak and fractured. Now that we are a united force, we can push back against Qara Khitan, repaying them for each blow they dealt to us."
 tcr_oirat_title:0 "Invade the Oirats"
 tcr_oirat_desc:0 "The Oirats lay between us and the Great Yuan. As a military force, the Oirat could be a powerhouse should they be united.

 tcr_rival_title:0 "Rival the Great Yuan"
 tcr_rival_desc:0 "While the Yuan ruled as masters of the East, unparalleled in strength and power, they are but a fraction of the threat they once were to our state.

 tcr_mongolia_title:0 "Tame the Mongols"
 tcr_mongolia_desc:0 "In the past, when the Kuci had refused to submit to the Mongol Empire, they sent their armies to burn our settlements and reduce our civilization to rubble.

 tcr_guard_title:0 "The Western Trade Route"
 tcr_guard_desc:0 "The trade routes that stretch from Baghdad to Beijing are dominated by various tribes and hordes that raise their taxes and tariffs on the goods that flow on the silk road.

 tcr_steppe_title:0 "Into the Steppes"

 tcr_khorasan_desc:0 "The Kushan Empire was, at one point, an empire that aided ours in our hour of need against the Han Dynasty. In the modern day, the land of the Kushan lays bare of their history, with few remnants of their might and power. We will honor their legacy and bring their territory into the fold, as a thank you to our ally long gone."

 tcr_schina_title:0 "Shatter the Jade Dragon"
 tcr_schina_desc:0 "The southern warlords continue to be a thorn in our side. We cannot allow another Chinese dynasty to rise up and become a threat to our empire just as the Han and Tang had done in ages prior. We shall ride down south, towards the coastline, and subjugate the warring states."
 tcr_india_title:0 "Wrath of Kanishka"
 tcr_india_desc:0 "Just as the Kushan did in centuries past, we shall push into the northern kingdoms of India, subjugating them and plundering their cities. Kanishka himself would be envious of our conquests to come!"

 tcr_nepal_desc:0 "Nepal is a strange border for our kingdom; the mountain range prevents movement between our Indian and Tibetan holdings save for a few key passes, and yet, if we do not secure these passes, we shall be left in a position where enemies could sneak through and attack our kingdoms. The mountains cannot hold the border alone; we must send troops to secure the passes and maintain the security of our realm."
 tcr_bengal_title:0 "The Bengal Campaign"

 tcr_rekindle_desc:0 "As our scientific and political thought continues to develop, many of our greatest minds have uncovered connections between the west and the Indian east through archeology and the study of language. Our ruler took it upon themselves to accentuate these connections, ass a method to unite the disparate cultures across our empire.

 tcr_roads_desc:0 "The Taklamakan stretches into the Tarim Basin. It takes many days for even a speedy caravan to make their way through the desert. We should build road networks in the region, to reconnect the corners of our kingdom to one another and to facilitate trade in the region."
 tcr_kuci_title:0 "Rebuild Kuci"
 tcr_kuci_desc:0 "The Mongolian invasion led to the utter destruction of the Kuci settlement; by the time they were done with the city, it was but rubble and pasture for their horses to trot upon. This bloody event, and the threat of future attacks to our people, was a major factor in the rebellion against the Chagatai. Many rulers now claim that they shall be the ones to rebuild our empire into what it once was, and many point to Kuci as the place they shall start with. While many rulers have promised to rebuild the city to its former glory, few have succeeded. However, if one were to complete the monumental task, it would truly signal the rise of the Tocharians as a cultural hub of learning and understanding."
 tcr_tax_title:0 "Tax the Merchant Caste"
 tcr_tax_desc:0 "The Merchant Caste grew large with the Mongolian revitalization of the silk road. Even with it diminishing since the decline of the Empire, merchants in our realm are often richer than many local lords.

 tcr_oasis_title:0 "Renovate the Oasis Forts"

 tcr_levy_title:0 "Reform the Levy System"
 tcr_levy_desc:0 "Our armies rely on Levies from local lords and elites. However, this leads to us being increasingly reliant on nobles who have ulterior motives and often traitorous goals.

 tcr_faith_title:0 "Secure the Faith"
 tcr_faith_desc:0 "Throughout the realm, we have people worshiping different faiths. Tibetan Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, traditional faiths, and various others to boot.

Even after the defeat of his armies, he refused to kneel before us and fled to his native lands. If we wish to punish him as he deserves, we need only crush those who protected him until he is totally isolated. He will then regret his felony, but in vain."
 yuan_horde_yam_title:0 "Rebuild the Yam"
 yuan_horde_yam_desc:0 "The Yam was a postal system and supply point route messenger system extensively used and expanded by Ögedei Khan and also used by subsequent Great Khans.

 yuan_horde_southern_title:0 "The Southern Campaign"
 yuan_horde_southern_desc:0 "Now that the whole of China is under our rule again, our desire is turned to the south. Their lands are nothing like our native steppes, but they trade in valuable goods and we have much to learn about their art of war. A campaign there could only benefit us."

 yuan_horde_tibet_desc:0 "Tibet was a territory that once lay under our control while under the Sakya Dynasty; however, due to the failings of our forefathers, the territory was lost to the Phagmodrupa rebels while we stood idly by and watched it happen.

 yuan_horde_gateway_desc:0 "Tibet was not an easy region to conquer and even if it can serve as a good border it is not the end of the Himalayas. Further south of Tibet lies Nepal and Kashmir - only parts of the mountainrange we do not control. It will be a costly campaign, but once we control all of Himalayas we can open up a new front that could allow us to surpass even Genghis Khan and succeed in invading a land that he failed three centuries ago: India. To make our nation's ancestral founder proud we ought to open the northern gates to India."

 yuan_horde_russia_desc:0 "The internal trouble within the Golden Horde created a power vacuum which was swiftly abused by the rebellious princedoms of Rus' who defied the Mongol rule.

 yuan_horde_yasa_title:0 "Reform the Yasa Code"
 yuan_horde_yasa_desc:0 "Yasa Code is the oral law code that Genghis Khan declared in Public in Bukhara and has served as a de facto law in our empire. However, besides the public announcement in Bukhara we haven't proclaimed it active in other regions of our realm. There is three clear things we must do with Yasa Code: 1. Codify it into text so we won't have to rely on spoken word with the law. 2. Make it publicly known in rest of the corners of Yuan. 3. Expand the once wartime decree into something that controls accepted cultural and lifestyle conventions."
 yuan_horde_dread_title:0 "Mounted Dread"

 mongols_nizzarids_desc:0 "Even the Great Khan had not pushed his conquests this far. Now that we are at the gates of Africa, our warriors are fascinated by these sandy steppes. These lands can belong to no one but us and this «caliph» who claims to rule over the region must be destroyed."

 gor_kingdoms_desc:0 "Korea has been split between the Goryeo and Joseon kingdoms for decades, both vying for supreme control over the Korean peninsula. Despite a period of relative peace, we cannot afford to remain passive for too long: let us build a grand army to finally end this strife between brothers."
 gor_resplendent_title:0 "Resplendent Army"
 gor_resplendent_desc:0 "Our army has withered and decayed like a wretched carcass ever since the Joseon rebellion; much of the standing force is comprised of aging veterans, with little in the way of fresh recruits. With a vastly untapped manpower pool at our fingertips, it may be advisable to not only institute a draft, but also reform the Resplendent Army. Long ago this reserve force was able to best the Khitans in battle, and soon it may prevail again!" 
 gor_capture_capital_title:0 "Capture Hanseong"
 gor_capture_capital_desc:0 "Namgyeong, our former Southern Capital, has been out of our hands since the Joseon revolt in 1392, when it was renamed Hanseong. To truly solidify our grasp over Korea and subjugate our foes once and for all, we must recapture Namgyeong!"
 gor_rebuilding_title:0 "Rebuilding the Forces"
 gor_rebuilding_desc:0 "Our troops are depleted and weakened from decades of war against our northern rival; if we are to unify Korea and once more become a great influence in East Asian politics, we must strengthen our military infrastructure. Only then will we be treated with the respect and fear we rightfully deserve!"
 gor_hwacha_title:0 "Construct the Hwach'a"
 gor_hwacha_desc:0 "For over a century, gundpowder and firearms have been an essential part of our military. The first weapons we developed with this technology were rockets and propelled arrows, but concepts of a weapon that can fire hundreds of arrows at once have been drawn up and proven effective. Let us refine this Hwach'a, construct it, and bring it to bear on our foes!"
 gor_fortify_korea_title:0 "Restore the Northern Wall"
 gor_fortify_korea_desc:0 "Before the division of Korea into two states, a large defensive network had been constructed in the north called the Cheolli Jangseong; the Thousand Li Wall. A massive series of fortifications spanning all of Korea's northern border like this cannot be left in disrepair. We shall renovate and expand upon it with the best materials and technology available, thereby ensuring Korea is never again threatened by an invader."
 gor_unite_korea_title:0 "Unite Korea"
 gor_unite_korea_desc:0 "We have united the two Korean states, but there is still land on the peninsula that is not yet ours. The Temugid Mongols remain a thorn in our side, and the Jurchens, our eternal rivals, still hold onto the northeast. If we are to unite Korea, we must defeat these tyrants!"
 gor_jurchens_title:0 "Invade Manchuria"
 gor_jurchens_desc:0 "Goguryeo, the mightiest of the Korean Three Kingdoms, owned a significant portion of the land now referred to as Manchuria. Many centuries have passed since then, but the idea of conquering the Jurchens to vanquish the northern threat remains. Let us act on it, and destroy our foes!"
 gor_rival_shogun_title:0 "Rival the Japanese"
 gor_rival_shogun_desc:0 "Although a part of the Mongol Empire on paper, the lands of Japan are anything but. Falling apart at the seams, the pro-Yuan shogunate is too feeble and decrepit to maintain its own authority! With a clear lack of hegemon in Japan we ought to set our eyes and attention upon the islands."
 gor_divine_wind_title:0 "Defy the Divine Wind"
 gor_divine_wind_desc:0 "Many fear that a particularly strong Japanese Shogun could attempt to extend his powers beyond the Japanese isles - in which case Korea would surely be a prime target. If we are to avoid this fate, we will have to change the equation and put the Japanese on the defensive. It is time that we may emulate the only respectable feat of the Mongols, and subjugate these disunited clans."
 gor_defeat_shogun_title:0 "Defeat the Shogun"
 gor_defeat_shogun_desc:0 "The Toyouji Shogunate's impotent reign has plunged Japan into a lengthy period of chaos and suffering, but its time is almost at an end. With the capture of Kyoto, the centre of Japan's leadership, our reign over the island archipelago shall soon be uncontested!"
 gor_inflitrate_title:0 "Inflitrate the Pirate Haven"
 gor_inflitrate_desc:0 "The beautiful waters off the coast hold many things that can be considered morally ugly or bastardly, most notably pirates. They, and their expertise in countering Japanese naval tactics, are a potential way for us to prepare, and gain insight to Japanese ports."
 gor_ghost_title:0 "The Ghost of Tsushima"
 gor_ghost_desc:0 "Tsushima was where Mongol Invasion of Japan began, and stands as a symbol of either great victory or shameful defeat, depending on who tells the story.

 gor_japanese_trade_title:0 "Japanese Trade"
 gor_japanese_trade_desc:0 "Japanese Trade is very important for us, as it allows our merchants to play the daimyo off of one another at increasing profit. If we are to ensure that our coffers will remain full, despite the growing expenses of our realm, we need to dominate Japan's trade."
 gor_naval_capacity_title:0 "Increase the Naval Capacity"

 gor_fleet_title:0 "Expand the Fleet"
 gor_fleet_desc:0 "As our sphere of influence expands, so too shall the navy. Let it never be said that we were insufficiently prepared to stave off pirate raids, or foreign invasions, because of our own shortcomings! We will rebuild the Goryeo Royal Navy to be bigger, better, and studier than ever before."
 gor_turtle_ships_title:0 "Set Sail the Turtle Ships"

 gor_dragon_throne_title:0 "The Dragon Throne"
 gor_dragon_throne_desc:0 "It has become clear that China no longer possesses the Mandate of Heaven, and so the mantle of responsibility rests in our hands.

 gor_mongol_title:0 "Mongol Intervention"
 gor_mongol_desc:0 "The Mongols are incapable of keeping themselves propped up as the masters of the Orient, and so it falls to us - their former subjects - to intervene and clean up the mess left behind. They could at least show some gratitude when we establish order, the Goryeo way."
 gor_north_china_title:0 "Unite North China"
 gor_north_china_desc:0 "After the fall of the imperial capital, it is only natural to expand further. Its previous occupants clearly seek to reclaim it, by any means necessary. It would be prudent to launch a preemptive strike, and bring all of northern China under heel, lest we find ourselves on the defensive."
 gor_celestial_empire_title:0 "The Celestial Empire"
 gor_celestial_empire_desc:0 "With China in ruins, and the Great Yuan a burnt out husk left by the dustbin of history, there is need of a new stabilising force in the land. Goryeo shall become that unifier, and ascend to the emperorship with the Mandate of Heaven as our right to rule!"
 gor_pacific_title:0 "Settle the Pacific Isles"

 gor_south_title:0 "Explore the Southern Seas"
 gor_south_desc:0 "There is talk amongst the western merchants of a hypothetical land to the far south of us, which they call Terra Australis. While nothing is known of it, we have little to lose by charting the area. Depending on what we find, we could even settle any new lands with our excess population of criminals."
 gor_colonial_empire_title:0 "A Colonial Empire"
 gor_colonial_empire_desc:0 "From bustling Oriental trade ports, to the remote Pacific outposts, our banner flies proudly. Though we started off a nation facing invasion and collapse, amidst a decades-long civil war, Korean is now synonymous with colonial empire. We have come farther than any before us, and none shall ever surpass us again."
 gor_development_title:0 "The Plight of the Peasantry"
 gor_development_desc:0 "Our peasantry make the enormous majority of our people. It would be very foolish of us to anger them, or we can risk revolts where peasantry refuse to work the fields and our country faces famine. The best way to rule over the masses is to appease them before they can get any thoughts to rebel. We need to invest heavily into our farmlands. If some of them fail then we will have other farms left standing."
 gor_feed_title:0 "Develop the Rice Fields"

 gor_gukjagam_title:0 "Modernise the Gukjagam"
 gor_gukjagam_desc:0 "The Gukjagam is one of the most elite institutions within our kingdom, and has served as a cornerstone of Confucian reform for centuries. As with all things, however, it has grown complacent and in many ways obsolete. Its prohibitive cost is certainly a key contributor to this, as student numbers have been steadily dropping since the Joseon Rebellion began. We must reform and restructure the Gukjagam if it is to survive into the modern age."
 gor_achieve_juche_title:0 "Achieve Self Reliance"
 gor_achieve_juche_desc:0 "Economic self-sufficiency is a goal any nation must aspire to, if it wishes to be truly independent from the shackles of others. Our former subservience to the Yuan, and the disaster it brought upon the Korean people, has shown us this truth. If we are to ascend to greater heights, we must adapt to relying only on ourselves. It may be difficult at first, but we will succeed where others fail."
 gor_prosperity_title:0 "Economic Prosperity"
 gor_prosperity_desc:0 "The most surefire way to bring a nation into an age of harmony and growth is by ensuring the domestic economy thrives. Through wise investments and a few sneaky tariffs levied against foreign shipments, we can usher in a period of economic prosperity."
 gor_rival_europe_title:0 "Rival the Europeans"
 gor_rival_europe_desc:0 "The Europeans are both a blessing and a curse, for while they no doubt introduced countless revolutionary innovations to our nation, their desire to conquer puts our sovereignty at risk. If we are to reach our full potential, the European encroachment upon our state must be curbed at any cost."
 gor_hainan_title:0 "Conquer Hainan"

 japan_south_title:0 "Charter the Southern Seas"
 japan_south_desc:0 "There is something further south - a landmass that's devoid of lush forests apart from keyfew spots due to how unwelcoming the climate and fauna are. It could serve as a suitable location to deport dissenters in our homelands - as far away from homeland as possible."

 japan_five_routes_desc:0 "Gokaido are our routes of great travel. They extend out from the city of Edo that's a center of sorts for these roads. With the wars that were fought on Japanese soil between the Mongol Shogunate and the Independent Daimyos the routes fell into partial disrepair due to the routes being split between the two forces. We ought to repair the routes and bring them back to their former luster."

 japan_christianity_title:0 "The Spread of Christianity"
 japan_christianity_desc:0 "'Jesus Christ was 21 years old when he came to Japan...' or that is how the Christians living in Shingo-mura like to tell the story of how Christianity came to the land. The true records of Christianity's arrival tell that it came to us first through merchants and later through missionaries. It remains a small scale faith, but due to its nature it is still rather disruptive to our orderly society. And yet, its coming provides us with an abnormal proposition: Convertion for diplomatic purposes. We could find ourselves perceived more as peers by the Europeans - maybe even possibly be capable to form alliances of immense ranges and come to become part of European affairs. The head of the Christian faith - The Pope - is after all a very powerful human that may look favorably to our convertion that he may look favorably upon us and look disfavorably at other europeans that do not accept us on diplomatic table. Whatever the decision is it is up to the only one who can decide for us: The Emperor. What will he decide: Old Traditional Ways or New Religious Faith?"

Through centralizing our economy around keyfey major companies we can have our economy run by companies that can afford investing huge amounts of their own profits back into their industries and won't need much outside help at sustaining themselves. Our economy shall be self-sufficient, with the Zaibatsus eternally indebted to us for creating them."

Cities are turning into the true source of power and revenue for the state - a source we ought to support in growing."
 japan_restoration_title:0 "The Imperial Restoration"
 japan_restoration_desc:0 "Foreign concepts flow into our nation - ideas that allure the Emperor along with his loyalists. Absolutism and its concept are tied heavily with the idea that the Monarch has divine right given from God to rule over the said nation. While we do not believe in the same faith as the inventors of the said concept in Europe it is still very compatible with our state, for our emperor is the son of the Sun Goddess and thus has divine right to rule over us. In true absolutist fashion we ought to expand his power so he may properly exercise his divine right to rule."
 japan_rising_title:0 "The Rising Sun"
 japan_rising_desc:0 "Japan is the land of Rising Sun - both in its meaning and in reality. And this reality shall be true in two fashions: Both in the symbolism of how when foreigners look over to Japan it is where the sun comes to them and in symbolism of how Japan itself is a Rising Sun - ever growing and ever flourishing. We will ascent to new heights as we will carry the shining beauty of the sun upon our shoulders and make our enemies jealous and our subservients humble."
 japan_education_title:0 "Reform the Education"
 japan_education_desc:0 "Our nation, if it is going to be on par with the Chinese, Mongolians or even the White Barbarians we ought to increase the literacy rates. If we are going to surpass others we need to be smarter than them. Bettering our education is the way to achieve both of these: As a country that can read is a smart country, and a smart country is a nation that will be able to think and adapt to future troubles."

 japan_capital_new_desc:0 "For centuries, Kyoto was our capital city, the symbol of the emperor and the Shogunate. However, now that the Shogunate has been disbanded and the emperor has regained his power, it seems that a new era is beginning for our country. To mark the occasion, some propose that we move our capital to a different city which would become the new imperial capital of Japan."
 japan_palace_title:0 "The Imperial Palace"

 japan_home_trade_desc:0 "Amongst the recent changes in our country is the opening up of Japan to the outside world, especially in terms of trade and foreign investment.

 japan_protect_pirates_title:0 "Protect Against the Pirates"
 japan_protect_pirates_desc:0 "For centuries, pirates have been a scourge for our country. Not only do the wakô plunder our coastline, but they act as a real deterrent to foreign traders, resulting in the isolation of our island. Now that we have ended the Sakoku period and are determined to open up Japan, we must destroy these pirates for good."
 japan_kaigun_title: "Teikoku Kaigun"
 japan_kaigun_desc:0 "Now that we are a true empire, we deserve a navy to match. We must build the most modern ships and recruit the best sailors we can find in order to be taken seriously by our rivals. By officially creating the Teikoku Kaigun, the Imperial Navy, we would show the world that we are entering the ranks of the great powers."
 japan_naval_capacity_title:0 "Increase the Naval Capacity"
 japan_naval_capacity_desc:0 "Our navy may have been vastly improved over the last few decades, but it is still not enough for our empire. We need to be able to build and repair our ships quicklier, to train our sailors faster, to expand our maritime sphere of influence. Only then will we deserve to be considered the best navy in the world."

 nll_aisin_desc:0 "Aisin Gioro is a cadet branch of the Wanggiyan, and therefore is tied to our great Nara Ula clan dynastically. They have often shown their ambitions of uniting the clans of the northeast, yet cannot act on it as of now: we must strike before they do, and eradicate this threat."

 mch_temples_desc:0 "t would prove beneficial to both internal revenue and the imperial cult if we were to centralise the religions of China into government-sanctioned temples. By charging worshippers over rites and entry fees, in the form of tithes, a little decrease in taxation to coincide may prove advantageous for public support of our regime."
 mch_cefeng_title:0 "Cefeng System"
 mch_cefeng_desc:0 "The Cefang system, otherwise known as the tributary system, was once used by the now-destroyed Yuan. To help reinforce the idea that we are the successor to them, and indeed the rightful sovereigns of China, we should make the tribute flow once again. As an added bonus, it may just keep our most unruly neighbours and satellites in check."
 mch_celestial_title:0 "The Celestial Empire"
 mch_celestial_desc:0 "The Celestial Empire is but one of many styles used to address our great state. We possess the rightful Mandate of Heaven, the greatest realm the world has ever seen, and the only true civilisation to boot!"
 mch_invade_north_china_title:0 "Invade North China"
 mch_invade_north_china_desc:0 "As the legitimate hegemons of China, it is only right that we expand our dominion to the unruly north, which has unfortunately seen itself torn asunder by roaming bands of marauders and steppe warlords. Only with our intervention can peace and prosperity return to the region."
 mch_south_china_title:0 "Secure the South"
 mch_south_china_desc:0 "With the dismantling of Yuan, and half of China already under our control, taking southern China only seems natural. Its loss to the Red Turbans and subsequent Han warlords, courtesy of the Yuan's unfathomable ineptitude and hubris, has already set unification back by over a century. Let us not delay any longer."
 mch_subjugate_viet_title:0 "Subjugate Dai Viet"
 mch_subjugate_viet_desc:0 "Though the Yuan had tried, and failed spectacularly, to conquer Indochina, we shall prove to be the exception! With the fall of Dai Viet, the rest of the peninsula shall rapidly fall to the advance of our invincible armies! In the future, chroniclers will be forced to applaud our supreme power!"
 mch_burma_title:0 "The Burma Campaign"
 mch_burma_desc:0 "The nation of Ava, though small, has been trying to imitate the grandeur of our own nation by setting up their own tributary states. This is clearly a sign that the Burmese would be better suited to life as imperial subjects, as opposed to living in the our eternal shadow."
 mch_taiwan_title:0 "Seize Taiwan"
 mch_taiwan_desc:0 "The island of Formosa has been claimed by several powers in the past, including prior imperial Chinese dynasties, however none of them had the competence to establish permanent colonies. With a little investment of both manpower and coin, we can rapidly settle this new frontier, and treat it as a springboard for further exploration."
 mch_mukden_title:0 "Build the Mukden Palace"
 mch_mukden_desc:0 "The Mukden Palace shall be erected to honour our everlasting victory over the vile Yuan oppressors, and what better way to deride our Mongolic foe than to integrate influences not only of Jurchen origin, but also of Tibetan and Chinese design."
 mch_capital_title:0 "Expand Beijing"
 mch_capital_desc:0 "The city of Beijing, formerly Yuan's capital of Khanbaliq, shall also serve as our own seat of power. To honor this city's importance, we should enact a grand public works policy to ingratiate the local population, while also expanding outwards and upwards to thwart the intense squalor left behind by Mongol neglect."
 mch_porcelain_title:0 "The Porcelain Market"
 mch_porcelain_desc:0 "One of the trade goods our empire is most known for is porcelain, often referred to as 'China' by clueless barbarians. To meet the growing demand from the west, we should reignite the Porcelain market, and capitalise on the Europeans' fascination with these luxury items."
 mch_great_wall_garrison_title:0 "The Great Wall"
 mch_great_wall_garrison_desc:0 "Though it was once used to try and keep both the Mongols, and us, out of China, it obviously failed to serve its purpose effectively. In order to secure and preserve our own overlordship against the barbarian menace, the Wall must be repaired, renovated, and expanded beyond its previous boundaries. China must never fall to outside threats again."
 mch_rice_title:0 "Develop the Rice Fields"
 mch_rice_desc:0 "Rice, throughout history, has been China's staple food. With vast fields of it, farmers are able to feed the majority of China’s population. We should make sure that we expand these fields to accommodate our growing population. Given enough time and investment, we may even be able to overcome famines entirely."
 mch_canals_title:0 "The Grand Canal"
 mch_canals_desc:0 "With the riches of China in our pockets, we should make sure the majority of our wealth doesn’t escape our trade sphere. The construction of a grand canal may aid our commerce enough that our ports will be the envy of the world."
 mch_industry_title:0 "The Industrial Revolution"
 mch_industry_desc:0 "The secret to the Europeans' unmatched wealth and power was their ability to rapidly manufacture high quality goods in great numbers. If we could adapt to the industrial model, we may soon be able to catch up to - and even surpass - the Europeans."
 mch_rail_title:0 "Introduce the Railroads"
 mch_rail_desc:0 "China is a vast territory, and if we ever hope to efficiently transport our troops across it, we must endeavour to construct a heavy rail network. This modern infrastructure could also help transport civilians and goods in times of peace."
 mch_green_title:0 "The Green Standard Army"
 mch_green_desc:0 "After decades of war and conquest, our nation needs a reserve force, which can take up the role of policing during peacetime. The former Yuan regiments, and those of the Han warlords, have long lost their use on the battlefield. Instead of disbanding them, however, we can reform them into the Green Standard Army, and fulfill the peacekeeping role while our Eight Banners ride forth to conquer."
 mch_study_title:0 "Study Foreign Technology"
 mch_study_desc:0 "The far away nations of Europe have started driving us out of our own sphere of influence as of late. Their eagerness to explore, combined with an insatiable desire for profit and overseas connections, may prove useful as a means of leverage. By establishing diplomatic ties with one of these foreign states, our access to their markets and technology will be ensured. A whole new world awaits China as it is propelled into the future!"

 tgu_kham_title:0 "Conquer Kham"
 tgu_kham_desc:0 "Our settlement in Jianqiang was a precarious one. Our forefathers, escaping the bloodshed of the Mongol invasions of the north, had to fight to survive in this new hostile land, but not with swords or spears, but through words and cunning. They managed relations, leveraged favors, and traded securities to make our dynasty dominant in the settlement and gathered a small army to our side. With the Red Turban Rebellion throwing off the Yuan from the region, we were surrounded on all sides by far more powerful warlords, and yet, we found weakness in the disorganized Kham region. We have already swayed many of their monasteries to our side; we must strike while the iron is hot and secure the region for our own!"
 tgu_tsang_title:0 "Claim U-Tsang"

 tgu_gansu_desc:0 "The Gansu region was, at one point, the home of our great empire. The Tangut people have longed to return there for many years, but the Yuan administration has dominated that area for centuries now. However, the Yuan are weak: their flanks exposed from years of warfare and internal divisions. We must strike while the iron is hot and push back into our homeland!"
 tgu_dali_title:0 "Invade Dali"

 tgu_way_title:0 "The Tangut Way"
 tgu_way_desc:0 "Tangut tradition revolves around the tantric practices of Buddhism as well as a fusion of local and ancient Tangut folk tales. Our faith is much of what kept our culture alive after the Mongol conquests, with our monks and scholars carrying our writings and artworks on their backs into the new homeland. We must promote this faith and this understanding all over our kingdom, for the good of all that serve under us."
 tgu_nirvana_title:0 "The Path to Nirvana"
 tgu_nirvana_desc:0 "With our conquests, we have come into contact with many different faiths. Some, the other schools of Buddhism, from the Southern Burmese and Chinese schools to the Hindu and local faiths of the southern hill tribes. We shall show them our way and path to a greater understanding, through tantric rituals and methods."
 tgu_xia_title:0 "Proclaim Xia"
 tgu_xia_desc:0 "In 1227, the heavens cried when our great empire failed in their revolt against the Mongol Empire and as their horses set fire to our cities and slaughtered our ancestors.

 tgu_shanxi_title:0 "Take Shaanxi"
 tgu_shanxi_desc:0 "Xingqing was once the capital of our great state. The Tangut remnant there still fly our banners in periods of unrest and rebellion; with our armies just a few days journey from the city’s walls, we must press on, and reclaim our capital city!"

 tgu_test_title:0 "Test the Song"
 tgu_test_desc:0 "The Song remain a dominant force in the fight against the Yuan; however, they are so focused on pushing up the yellow river, they would fail to see us approaching from behind. We shall test their strength and see if they truly are the force to take down the menace of the Yuan."
 tgu_legacy_title:0 "The Tangut Retribution"
 tgu_legacy_desc:0 "Genghis Khan’s people rode into our lands, setting fire to our cities, killing our people, all in an attempt to eradicate us.

We shall make sure that they will never be a threat to us again."
 tgu_eastern_xia_title:0 "Recreate Eastern Xia"
 tgu_eastern_xia_desc:0 "East Xia and their Jurchen leaders were destroyed by the Mongols during their fight for freedom. We shall re-assemble that kingdom within our Empire, ending this period of squabbling and infighting amongst their tribes."

 tgu_skies_title:0 "The White Skies"
 tgu_skies_desc:0 "Our great emperor has pushed forward and taken countless provinces and cities, that was once owned by the proud and mighty Mongols. We now walk in the halls that the once the Song and Jin used to rule from, both failing in their attempts to conquer our great state. The only one to ever be able to defeat us, the Mongol, have been felled. Kingdom of the Great Xia of the White and Lofty Mother now rules as emperors supreme, and all of China shall be our domain!" 
 tgu_hunan_title:0 "Push into Hunan"

 tgu_wuchang_title:0 "Conquer Wuchang"
 tgu_wuchang_desc:0 "Hubei lies before us, under the control of the Han. Another vastly wealthy region, and the forces of the Han remain a constant threat to us. We shall take the city and exert more pressure on the rest of China from there, a new vantage point in our expansion."

 tgu_court_title:0 "Unite the Court"
 tgu_court_desc:0 "Our court, split between the temple monks, the tribal elders, and our generals and soldiers, can rarely work together on any single matter. Since the coup of Li Bo, our court has remained fragile and prone to infighting as each side attempts to overcome the other in order to dominate the state. We must unite our institutions and end the squabbling if we are to survive in this hostile environment."
 tgu_roads_title:0 "The Road Network"
 tgu_roads_desc:0 "As our empire grows both into the Tibetan plateau and the Chinese fields, our armies find themselves needing to travel farther and farther distances. We should expand our road networks in order to facilitate faster travel."
 tgu_production_title:0 "Agricultural Production"
 tgu_production_desc:0 "The Tibetan agricultural sector has been declining in the years since the collapse of the Sakya institution. Each year, crop yields are lesser and lesser, and monasteries are forced to pay less and less tax to their secular lords as they simply have nothing more to give. Under a united and watchful eye, we could be able to expand the crop growth and turn many of the downtrodden peoples in Tibet to be loyal subjects of the Tangut."
 tgu_income_title:0 "Wealth and Riches Untold"
 tgu_income_desc:0 "The old Xi Xia state was known for extracting massive amounts of wealth from both raiding the Jin and Song. We shall replicate that wealth, but over many diverse fields, from trade, tax, and of course, plunder as well."
 tgu_silk_title:0 "Dominate the Silk Road"
 tgu_silk_desc:0 "The Silk Road has been home to many different tribes and kingdoms since the collapse of the Mongols in the region. However, if it were under one banner, the wealth that would flow out of that region would be more than anything in our wildest dreams. We must secure it for our kingdom and take up the mantle of caretakers of the Silk Road."

 tgu_future_title:0 "The Future of our People"
 tgu_future_desc:0 "At its peak, the Minag, or Tangut People, were one of the most respected cultures in China. We were a dominate force that even the mighty Han and Mongol respect; now, we have barely a handful of cities under our control, and few of the common people even speak our tongue. We must bring our language and traditions back from the brink of extinction and resurrect our culture in these new territories that we control!"
 tgu_tradition_title:0 "Military Tradition"
 tgu_tradition_desc:0 "Our military, with the mighty Iron Hawks and Trekkers, once defeated the Song invaders and held back the Mongols for as long as they could. However, they have since fallen into disrepair; we must rebuild our core army, utilizing modern weaponry, and create a military force strong enough to defend against any invasion."
 tgu_cannon_title:0 "The Cannon of Xia"
 tgu_cannon_desc:0 "Our old cannons used to be carried on the backs of camels into the battlefield, from which we would fire upon our enemies with a thunderous roar. We shall once more utilize our Cannoniers to blast through even the mightiest walls and fortifications that we come across!"
 tgu_return_title:0 "Return of the Tangut"
 tgu_return_desc:0 "In the streets, the children play, talking and singing old Tangut melodies. The scholars and monks recite poems and translate works into our tongue, while martials and drill sergeants bark orders to weary Iron Hawks in training. Across our Empire, the Tangut culture has been reborn and expanded to both new homes and old. This is the new golden age of the Tangut, and we must continue to export our traditions and culture!"
 tgu_shining_title:0 "Shining and Sparkling"
 tgu_shining_desc:0 "Tangut art always captured the fascination of those who viewed it, drawing from both Chinese and Tibetan styles. Often religious, the art would portray heavenly figures and bodhisattvas passing their knowledge down to us and were painted in murals and in caves. We shall recreate this artistic style in the modern day, to expand awareness of our heritage and past."
 tgu_capital_title:0 "Reconstruct the Capital"
 tgu_capital_desc:0 "Xingqing was destroyed during the Mongol Sacking in the 13th Century.

 tib_take_assam_title:0 "Claim Assam"
 tib_take_assam_desc:0 "Beneath the mighty Himalayan peaks lied the region of Assam, which is known for its immense wealth. Claiming such wealthy and strategic area would surely increase the income of the state and create a stepping stone for further expansion southwards."
 tib_tanguts_title:0 "Integrate the Tanguts"
 tib_tanguts_desc:0 "Our conquest of the southern Kham territories and the Tangut peoples present us with an opportunity. The Tangut people are wise and strong kind, that were able to withstand the Song and the Jin; it would be foolish to let their talents go to waste. We shall work to integrate these people into our state."
 tib_bonpo_title:0 "The Bonpo Administration"
 tib_bonpo_desc:0 "Bon, in this age, is still somewhat practiced, and if anything, has seen something of a revival since the fall of the Tibetan Empire. While they are a minority religion within our Kingdom, it would be wise to utilize their talents to our advantage. These communities that still practice the faith could be extremely valuable to us, and as such, we shall work to integrate their practices and customs, as per the Lama dictates, into our own traditions and rites."

 amdo_lamas_desc:0 "In the past when the Tibet region was completely under the control of the Yuan Dynasty, we would be the ones to send Lamas to Beijing for conformation to the Sakya Administration. We should rebuild a similar institution, however, instead of the Lamas leaving our grasp, we shall instead make them a part of our own court, further cementing our great leader as the true rulers of Tibet!"
 amdo_script_title:0 "Dictate a New Script"
 amdo_scropt_desc:0 "The Phags-pa script, originally written by a Monk from within our region, was the language of the Empire for some time. We must capitalize on this tradition and produce a new script to encompass the different peoples and cultures within our growing empire."
 amdo_monasteries_title:0 "Expand the Monasteries"
 amdo_monasteries_desc:0 "The valleys and peaks of Amdo are sparse and empty; the treasury of our state is filled with gold and plunder from our conquests. If we are to continue our support for the monastic institutions in this region, we should build temples across our realm."
 amdo_priests_title:0 "Supporting the Sangha"
 amdo_priests_desc:0 "The monks within our state are a powerful political entity. In fact, we draw as much of our legitimacy from them as we do our mighty army. As such, we have to court them and maintain positive relations with them. If we should fail in this effort, we could collapse into ourselves rapidly, and lose what little territory we own."
 amdo_nestorian_title:0 "The Nestorian Expansion"
 amdo_nestorian_desc:0 "The Nestorians have invaded the Tocharian territories to the west of us. Not only do they follow a foreign religion to our own, but they pose a loyalty to a being of higher authority than our own great Khan. We must stamp out this movement and promote the true faith to our citizens."

 amdo_tibet_title:0 "Unify the Tibetan State"
 amdo_tibet_desc:0 "With Lhasa and the Kham region under our control, we must expand our reach to the furthest reaches of Tibet – to the lands of the Tangut and Guge, so that we can proclaim ourselves as the true lords and successors to the Tibetan Empire!"
 amdo_kham_title:0 "Conquer Kham"
 amdo_kham_desc:0 "The Kham region is filled with quarrelling kings and tribesmen. Greatest amongst them are Lingtsang and Gongjo, rivalling states that wage war back and forth with one another. We must take this territory and show their petty lamas and lords how to actually rule!"
 amdo_gansu_title:0 "The Gansu Territory"
 amdo_gansu_desc:0 "Ages ago, our lords gained control over the Gansu region in the wars we fought with the Xi Xia. However, the Yuan stole them from us in the battle of politics and schemes. We must demand that they return them, lest we remind them of how we first came to own that territory."
 amdo_throne_title:0 "Usurp the Dragon Throne"
 amdo_throne_desc:0 "The Yuan are a weak and pathetic dynasty. They lost control of the South to the rebels, failed to even keep their own subject at bay, and were blindsided by our own rise to power. Perhaps a new dynasty should rise to supplant them?"
 amdo_tocharia_title:0 "Claim the Tarim Basin"
 amdo_tocharia_desc:0 "The Tarim Basin is home to powerful states that insist upon interfering with Tibetan affairs. We shall remind them of the terror of the Mongols, and ride to subjugate these unruly tribes."

 amdo_himalaya_title:0 "Himalayan Frontier"
 amdo_himalaya_desc:0 "These mountains stretch far and wide. They could protect us from any invasion to the south, should we hold and fortify the passes between them. We must push south and gain control of this terrain, as undisputed masters of the Himalayas."

 amdo_economy_title:0 "Improve the Economy"
 amdo_economy_desc:0 "Tibet is a poor society, materially. Their wealth comes from either simple subsistence farming or from the riches their monasteries gain in donation.

Unfortunately, we lack the military strength to fulfil our role successfully: if we are to solidify or even expand the League in the future, a larger army will be sorely required."
 hansa_holstein_title:0 "Conquer Holstein"
 hansa_holstein_desc:0 "The Counts of Holstein derive great wealth from their tactical position straddling the North Sea and Baltic Sea. Conquering them and the Slavs nearby would make us rich indeed, and could pave the way to further expansion north and east."
 hansa_weser_title:0 "Expand Hansa"
 hansa_weser_desc:0 "The Hansa's core lands in Hamburg and Bremen are only connected by sea, not by land. Making our territories contiguous would be a worthwhile endeavour, and would give us further control over the rich Weser river and its surrounding areas."
 hansa_jutland_title:0 "Claim Jutland"
 hansa_jutland_desc:0 "For centuries, traders have had the choice of sending their wares over land via Hamburg and Lübeck or sailing around Jutland, going through Denmark instead.

 hansa_conquer_danzig_title:0 "Seize Danzig"
 hansa_conquer_danzig_desc:0 "Danzig is a great bastion of Catholic civilisation in the vast expanse of paganism on the Baltic Sea. Due to this, they have been steadfast allies of the League for years: yet that may not be the case for long, as their cities grow to rival even ours in size and power. Dominate Danzig, and the riches of the Vistula will be ours!"
 hansa_pirates_title:0 "The Pirate Haven"
 hansa_pirates_desc:0 "The city of Visby, led by the Norse pagans in Gotland, has been a wretched thorn in the side of all Christendom for too long. Pirates depart from their ports to sack and loot the span of the Baltic Sea, destroying trade that would otherwise have come to our shores. Let us crush Visby under our heel, and reap the rewards!"
 hansa_conquer_riga_title:0 "Conquer Riga"
 hansa_conquer_riga_desc:0 "Riga, like Danzig, is a city built by Hanseatic sailors in the centre of the pagan Balts. Albeit not as rich as the Danzigers, the city of Riga would be a fantastic addition to our centralised Hanseatic [Root.GovernmentName]!"

 hansa_north_sea_desc:0 "In the past, our main source of wealth was always trade with the East. Now, however, the riches of Russia are increasingly dwarfed by the immense wealth flowing from the west.

 #Temugids
 tmg_legacy_title:0 "Legacy of Temüge"
 tmg_legacy_desc:0 "Our Clan's origins come from Genghis Khan's brother - Temüge. In childhood and adolescence he was spoiled somewhat by mother and older brothers, but did not show signs of softening despite the spoilage. He was a courageous man - a powerful man that was quick in battle. As per Mongol tradition he was the child to inherit his and Genghis' father's belongings. Although Genghis saw him as shiftless, he was a capable ruler who ruled the Heartland in brothers' absence quite competently. Though not the youngest child of Genghis he was ambitious to claim the throne of Mongol Empire when Ögedei Khan died and his son was fighting in Russia. His seizure attempt was thwarted by Ögedei's widow. When Güyük was elected as Great Khan our founder was executed. Shameful end for our founder. As centuries have come to pass we festered in the far reaches of Mongol World, yet close to our home. As the Crisis of 15th century has come it has opened a potential: A potential for revenge for our ancestor's death. A potential... To return home and take what is rightfully ours: Mongolia."

However, we ought to make a small detour on our path to our neighbouring Jurchen tribes, more specifically Wanggiyan.

We ought to foster a stronger sense of camaraderie with these noble warriors who we are so proud to have by our sides now and in future."

Raise the black tugh; Blow the horns of war; Invade Yuan!"
 tmg_mandate_title:0 "Redefine the Mandate"

We believe in the Eastern Christ of Nestorianism. Though the Mandate of Heaven is a concept older than Christianity it is only slightly blasphemous in how it claims the emperor to get the divine right to rule by being a descendant of God. Mandate of Heaven can easily be manipulated into becoming more compatible with the Eastern Bible."
 tmg_north_china_title:0 "Avenge Prince Nayan"
 tmg_north_china_desc:0 "Nayan was a bulwark of Mongol identity - a Prince that stood up against the Yuan giant at the sight of growing sinicisation shown by Kublai Khan. Though not a Temügid we have come to see him as a symbol of resistance against the Yuan in year since the time of Kublai Khan, for he, much like Temüge, was wrongly executed for doing what was right. He should not let his rebellion be in vain: We should avenge his fall by pushing Yuan out."
 tmg_reject_title:0 "Reject Sinification"
 tmg_reject_desc:0 "We are nothing like the Yuan that disgraced the Mongol ways. We are nothing like the Yuan that disgraced Genghis Khan. We are nothing like the Yuan that disgraced Nayan. We are not Chinese! Sinicisation is the sign of Satan's presence on Earth - a disease that festers upon this land that keeps sprouting if not put out with a fire and zeal. Two centuries were enough to do immense damage to our cultural definition as many of our southernmost brothers have started to imitate the Chinese wretches. Let us cast aside the Chinese snakes and let the Mongol identity re-emerge stronger than ever before - if not even shove it down the throat of the idolatrous Chinese."
 tmg_idols_title:0 "Destroy the False Idols"
 tmg_idols_desc:0 "The Eastern Christ is the true Christ, and the Nestorian God is the true god. It is blashemous how darkened by the lies of the false idols the masses are. Temügids are a morning star sitting alone in a dark sky - a dark sky we are obligated to bring light to."
 tmg_middle_title:0 "The Middle Kingdom"
 tmg_middle_desc:0 "Temüge, if only you saw where we are now then you would be proud, for we've avenged you! Nayan, if only you saw us then you would be proud, for we've put an end to Sinicisation! Jesus, if only you saw us you would be proud, for we've on our path to rid China from the last of its idolatrous ways! Though the Chinese are a permanent threat to us they are even greater threat if they remain as idol worshippers. That can't do. We must make the values of Chinese match ours, and the way to do that is by conquering the remainder of China under the Mongolian banner. What was once conquered by Genghis shall be conquered by his brother's descendants."
 tmg_christianize_title:0 "Christianize China"

Yuan housed their capital in Beijing and directed all of their wealth and splendor there, leaving Qaraqorum to wither and die until it stopped being a center of a great empire. The importance of the city may have faded it would be wrong to let it continue its downward decline. Instead we ought to help the city recover atleast a portion of its former glory - under Temügid surveillance."

As we build temples we should aim to model them after the temples that are local to the area, rather than base them upon the foreign and alien shapes and methods used in far-away lands. There's a reason these temple styles exist in our lands, and it would be foolish not to adapt our places of worship to fit the mold where necessary."

 nicene_stratocratic_desc:0 "The State needs generals. The State needs soldiers. There is one estate among our ranks that have traditionally taken the role of these in exchange of earning their status of wealth and prestige - Nobility. We should revert the status of nobility back to that of a warrior estate in our society if we are to have an ample source of loyal warriors."
 nicene_infrastructure_title:0 "Military Infrastructure"
 nicene_infrastructure_desc:0 "If we are to have a modern army we will need to have modern military infrastructure. Recruitment of new conscripts shall be made quicker, and training of new conscripts shall be made more efficient. New training halls shall be set up to allow us to harness the sheer potential pool of warriors our nation can muster."
 nicene_refugees_title:0 "Accept Roman Refugees"
 nicene_refugees_desc:0 "Some would say we hate Romans, but that is wrong. We hate Rome that has brainwashed our fellow Greek speaking peoples into believing that they are the same people as Latin imposters. We hate Rome for how it repesents corruption and decadence and selfish greed. We hate Rome, but not its citizens. If we accept in the Roman refugees we can do our best to make them make a new home in Nicaea and undo the damage Rome did to their identities."
 nicene_countryside_title:0 "Restore Greek Countryside"
 nicene_countryside_desc:0 "War, Plague and misplacement of peoples have resulted in the countryside becoming devoid of population while cities grew more and more overcrowded. The statusquo was sustainable, but it was destabilizing and made our beautiful countryside look sadly barren. We should focus our efforts towards solving this issue by incentivizing the repopulation of countryside with economical assistance to new Greek farmers."
 nicene_renaissance_title:0 "Hellenic Renaissance"
 nicene_renaissance_desc:0 "After centuries suffering under Roman Yoke first sparks of a Greek identity and culture have finally begun to emerge. We should cherish these sparks and add fuel to it. We need to support artists, philosophers and other intelligentsia to turn the spark to a proper burning phoenix."
 nicene_hellespont_title:0 "Secure the Hellespont"
 nicene_hellespont_desc:0 "The Hellenics used to rule over the trade in Aegean Sea and to a portion outside of it in Black Sea and rest of Mediterranean in ages past. We were the masters of trade, but now the story is different as the power of mediterranean trade has shifted inland. If we are to regain our former position of power we need to begin our journey towards mercantile dominance and fund the beginning of new merchant families in our state."
 nicene_east_title:0 "Control East Mediterranean"
 nicene_east_desc:0 "East Mediterranean is the bed of Mediterranean Trade in ancient times. We are almost obligated to return back to the old glorious of mercantilism and trade. If we can dominate the Eastern Mediterranean trade well enough we can cut off the Italians' revenue of wealth and stream it our way. Meditarrean shall be turned into a Greek sea once more."
 nicene_nationalism_title:0 "Greek Nationalism"
 nicene_nationalism_desc:0 "What are we who have become masters of our own fates, carrying several millennias of history? What are we who have had our identity squashed and washed into vile Rome's subjects through centuries of subjugation? Greeks. We are Greeks, and we know it, and so should our subjects remember that. Our identity was replaced with that of Roman one for far too long, but we will now re-embrace our true identity as Greeks of Mediterranean - The bed of western civilization."
 nicene_eclipse_title:0 "Eclipse the West"
 nicene_eclipse_desc:0 "The western nations have come to admire our arts through a western lens since the days of Renaissance, but their appreciation of the Greek arts and wisdom is wrong: It is but a crude mimicry. They are barbarians dressing up in civilized clothing. We ought to show the Western Europe that the center of Europe is not in Paris or in Rome or in Aachen, but in Nicaea."
 nicene_greek_fire_desc:0 "When they seemed doomed, the Romans were often saved by a formidable weapon, Greek fire, capable of destroying an entire fleet. Although the secret of its manufacture is jealously guarded, some individuals - driven by the ruin of the empire - would no doubt be likely to provide it."
 nicene_aegean_desc:0 "Dividing Europe and Asia, the Aegean Sea is not only an important commercial crossroads but also a highly strategic location for anyone wishing to dominate the region. While for centuries it has been the exclusive property of the Romans, it is time we took full control of it."
 nicene_latins_desc:0 "Although they failed to take Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, the Latins nevertheless managed to establish themselves permanently in the region. Now that we are the masters, it is time to drive them out forever, to punish them for their treachery and secure our influence in the area."
 nicene_smyrna_desc:0 "Smyrna is one of the last Roman strongholds in Anatolia. By seizing the province, we would deprive the empire of an important port and resources from Asia, thus dealing it a decisive blow."
 nicene_byzantium_desc:0 "It is the city of the world's desire. Unviolated for centuries, no enemy has yet reached its heart. Some say it is impregnable, but it seems to us that the death knell has sounded for the Roman Empire. Constantinople is ours!"
 nicene_hellenic_desc:0 "From the outset, we have followed in the footsteps of Alexander the Great. War after war, battle after battle, we defeated the enemy armies that stood between us and our destiny. Now the truth is undeniable, we are the true heirs of Alexander. Long live the Hellenic Empire!"
 nicene_bulgaria_desc:0 "Taking advantage of the weakness of the Roman Empire in the east and the absence of a major rival in the west, the Bulgarians acquired an already substantial kingdom and even dreamed of becoming an empire. Sadly for them, the truth is coming, hanging on the spike of our sarissas."
 nicene_secure_desc:0 "For centuries now, Greece has not been independent but a prisoner of the Roman yoke. With the empire now reduced to nothing, it is up to us to take up arms and free her - under our rule, of course."
 nicene_fortify_desc:0 "Our legions are powerful, capable of defeating any army. However, we remain vulnerable to an enemy landing. If we do not want them to take advantage of this opportunity, we must at all costs implement new means of defence in order to guarantee the integrity of our coastline."
 nicene_sack_desc:0 "Two centuries ago, the Venetians wanted to take advantage of the crusade and the generosity of the Basileus to besiege and take Constantinople. Although they failed miserably, we do not forget their treachery and it is now time for them to pay the ultimate price."
 nicene_egypt_desc:0 "Following the death of Alexander, General Ptolemy was appointed satrap of Egypt, thus facilitating the administrative management of the empire. We could similarly delegate Egypt to a governor in order to concentrate on the heart of the empire and our future conquests. There is, however, the minor problem of simply having to ensure his unfailing loyalty..."
 nicene_mesopotamia_desc:0 "Mesopotamia is of singular importance to us. The cradle of civilisation, it is also the place where it all ended, where Alexander tragically died in Babylon, plunging his empire into decades of instability and internal strife. Now that we are on its doorstep, all that remains is for us to take possession of this highly symbolic region as our sacred duty requires us to do"
 nicene_persepolis_desc:0 "Centuries earlier, the city of Persepolis was burnt down by Alexander in retaliation for the sack of Athens by Xerxes. Now that we have recaptured the city, we have the choice of continuing Alexander's legacy or ending this cycle of revenge and securing the support of the local population."
 nicene_shah_desc:0 "Now that we have completed the conquest of Persia, we could, like Alexander before us, crown ourselves Shahanshah, king of kings. In this way we would show the whole region that we are not their oppressor but rather their legitimate ruler."
 nicene_bactria_desc:0 "Having pushed his conquests as far as India, Alexander the Great left a multitude of Greek kingdoms in his wake. Although these are now only a distant memory, the culture and influence of the Bactrian kingdoms can still be felt, encouraging us to re-establish our rule in the area."
 nicene_india_desc:0 "Before our eyes lie the ancient borders of Alexander's empire. He who has been our model all this time has seen his work finally completed again. It is now up to us to go beyond him and to continue our conquests ever further, towards this new continent that is now opening up to us."
 nicene_legions_desc:0 "Inheriting both the best of the Greek and Roman worlds, our armies are feared by all our neighbours. Their iron discipline and high morale make them our best tool for dominating our rivals. Therefore, we must not hesitate to develop our legions further."
 nicene_levantine_desc:0 "Our storytellers always sing the tale of the siege of Tyre, painful for the Macedonian armies, and then Alexander's masterful victory subduing the whole region at once. Let us follow his example and subjugate the Levant under our name."
 nicene_nemesis_desc:0 "The birth of Islam represented a devastating blow for both Christendom and the Hellenic sphere of influence. On the path to reclaim our long-lost glory, we shall put an end to the arch enemy of Christianity!"

 ilk_corruption_desc:0 "Corrupt Mongol warlords and opportunistic tribal traitors plague our state; a seemingly insurmountable obstacle from our nomadic legacy. We must ensure that the state is reformed in a more stable image."

 ilk_revitalize_desc:0 "The previously rich trade routes that pass through our lands have run dry. To fund the rebuilding of our state, we must first rebuild our economy."

 ilk_georgia_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Georgia views itself as the remote bastion of Christianity in the east. We'll shatter this illusion with cold steel, and consolidate their strategically important lands into our domain."
 ilk_seljuks_desc:0 "The Seljuk Turks, our fellow nomads, have not learned from their mistakes, it seems. By cutting this poorly organized state down to size, we can open the path towards further expansion into Anatolia and beyond."
 ilk_caspian_desc:0 "The Caspian Sea, the world's largest inland body of water, is integral to the Silk Trade, and serves as a gateway to the eastern steppe. By asserting naval control over this sea, we can assure domination over the trade in the region, and sweep aside the Caspian states."
 ilk_home_trade_desc:0 "Persia may be one of, if not the, richest trading regions in the world. By assuring that we are among the dominant players in control of local trade, we can exert further influence over the region."
 ilk_appease_desc:0 "As a consequence of our homeland's richness, Persian merchants have always held a great deal of sway with their governments. Through the satisfaction of our merchants, the Khan can ensure the stability of the economy."
 ilk_tabriz_desc:0 "The city of Tabriz has emerged as the capital of our state. We would do good to encourage the population and economic growth of the locale."
 ilk_observatory_desc:0 "Maragheh Observatory, constructed in 1259, was once considered the greatest observatory in the world by many astronomers. The scholars of our land deserve to see this disrepaired structure returned to its former state."
 ilk_centers_desc:0 "The cities of Persia string together to form the traditional route of the silk road. By making each of these cities as safe, prosperous, and welcoming as possible, we can protect and grow the trade network."
 ilk_levantine_desc:0 "The Levant's domination by Islamic powers serves as a bitter reminder of the limitations of our Mongol ancestors. We will avenge the losses of our forefathers and bring the prosperous cities of Syria under our rule."
 ilk_egypt_desc:0 "The sons of Nizzar have spent enough time as the insufferable gray stain on our maps. Their days of bloody oppression and veneration of long-dead Greek kings ends now!"
 ilk_asia_desc:0 "Having swept away the Seljuks, we find ourselves at odds with the remaining states of Asia Minor, notably Nicaea, whose military arrogance is laughable. Who are they to stand in the way of our conquest?"
 ilk_capture_desc:0 "The petty states of Anatolia are dealt with. Ahead lies the so-called "City of the World's Desire". We find it scarcely holds a candle to Tabriz, but nonetheless, the prestige associated with controlling this city is unquestionable."
 ilk_mesopotamia_desc:0 "Beyond the fearsome Zagros range lies Mesopotamia, perhaps the most fertile region on the planet. This prosperous area will serve as a perfect staging ground for our inevitable conquest of Persia."
 ilk_heartland_desc:0 "Having evaded our control for centuries, beyond Azerbaijan, lies the last remnant of the Sassanid empire. The so-called “King of Kings” will soon realize that his time is up, and that we are far more fearsome than the Arabs, Turks, and assorted groups that the Sassanids have managed to avoid conquest by."
 ilk_gulf_desc:0 "The Persian gulf is a prosperous region in which trade from India flows into Arabia and Persia. By controlling the strait at its edge, we can control the flow of goods in and out of this vital artery of global exchange."
 ilk_afghan_desc:0 "The so-called "Graveyard of Empires" will certainly be a challenge for our armies, but we think we have faced worse attrition."

 ilk_embrace_desc:0 "Tengri, lord of the blue sky, forgive us, but it is time to say goodbye. The old ways have run their course, and the men of our court have turned the minds of our people to a new faith. Ahura Mazda will guide us to victory."
 ilk_rekindle_desc:0 "The sacred flames of Zoroaster have been stamped out in the wake of Sassanid territorial contraction. To ensure the future of our faith, we must restore these holy sites."
 ilk_monument_desc:0 "The fire temple of Baku is an ancient site of the faith. This monument will serve as a new center of religion in our empire."
 ilk_persianate_desc:0 "Our language, court culture, and traditions have eroded over the centuries from their Mongol roots, transforming into something new entirely. It seems that like every great conqueror of Persia, we have fallen victim to cultural conversion by our own subjects. But no matter..."
 ilk_stabilize_desc:0 "The changes to our realm have not gone over well with some of our subjects. In order to prevent further infighting, it is imperative that we project an image of stability and authority."
 ilk_court_desc:0 "The court of the Khan has been dominated by local Persians for long enough that integrating them into formal administrative roles only seems like the natural next step in our gradual persianization."
 ilk_iranzamin_desc:0 "Having reformed our religion, court, and state, it is only natural that we adopt a new identity as a nation. Henceforth, the world will know Iranzamin as the only successor to the ancient Achaemenid empire, and the true suzerains of Iran."
 ilk_outposts_desc:0 "The rich lands of India are opening up to foreign traders like never before. Considering our proximity, we should establish ourselves as among the first to claim land in India for ourselves."
 ilk_spice_desc:0 "The lucrative spice trade is dominated in the east by the kingdoms of the Malaccan straits, but further west, control is more dispersed. If we seize control of this coveted resource, we can even further increase our trade profits. The Spice Road will be just as vital as the Silk Road."
 ilk_bahrain_desc:0 "Bahrain is a lucrative territory in that trade flows through it, and it is strategically important for military affairs in the Gulf. We'd do ourselves a disservice by letting it go unconquered."
 ilk_arabia_desc:0 "Like the Sassanids before us, we shall conquer the Gulf Coast Arabs. It is only right that the people of the Persian Gulf be ruled by their eponymous Persian overlords."
 ilk_academy_desc:0 "Gondishapur in Ctesiphon shall be the site of a great center of scholarship, staffed by the most learned men in Iranzamin, open to those of all colors, creeds, and classes. Scientific advancement and learning have always been central values of Persian empires."
 ilk_ctesiphon_desc:0 "After nearly a millennia of Arab rule in the region, the former City of Ctesiphon is nothing more than a complex of ruins eclipsed by Baghdad. We will avenge this wrongdoing and restore the great capital of Mithridates."
 ilk_nahrawan_desc:0 "The irrigation systems of Mesopotamia, previously some of the most advanced in the world, have fallen to the grips of nature during the centuries of war that have plagued the region. Under our stable rule, we can rebuild the farming infrastructure, starting with a great canal to expand the arable area of the land."
 ilk_industrial_desc:0 "Silk, spices, paper, bread, and rugs are just some of the goods we are famous for exporting. In the wake of new technology, we can produce at a rate never seen before, putting our massive population to good use in factories, large farms, and workshops, where they will handle new machines and manufacture the goods of the future."
 ilk_bread_desc:0 "Just as Egypt was a breadbasket to the Roman and Byzantine empires, we shall make use of the Tigris and Euphrates to transform the Mashriq into our very own granary."
 ilk_indus_desc:0 "With our foothold in India, it seems only right to set out to do what no Iranian empire has done before, and dominate Hindustan itself, starting with the fertile Indus River valley."
 ilk_dread_title:0 "Mounted Dread"
 ilk_dread_desc: "The way of the steppe beckons. Our ancestors, should they be alive and by our side at this very moment, would balk at the composition of armies today. Let us honour them and return to the ways of the open plains- mounted, unstoppable, invincible dread." 
 ilk_guard_title:0 "Restore the Kheshig Guard"
 ilk_guard_desc: "The symbol of our powerful horde, our khan is feared throughout the world. However, his power is the envy of many and some would not hesitate to kill him to take his place. For this reason, the khan needs a loyal guard, ready to protect him at all costs, day and night. Genghis Khan had given us an example: the Kheshig guard must be restored!"
 ilk_central_asia_title:0 "Restore Rule on the Steppe"
 ilk_central_asia_desc: "With Persia secured, we can no longer let the central steppe go ignored. During the height of the Great Khan, all of the plains laid within our grasp. One could ride unmolested from Khanbaliq to Sarai. Let us extend our grasp across the steppe once more and remind its petty horse lords who their rightful Khan is."
 ilk_tibet_title:0 "Rule Tibet"
 ilk_tibet_desc: "Not only does Tibet stand as a vital mountain region, rife with gateways to further conquests, it is also the ancestral home of the Dalai Lama. Offering the Dalai Lama and his folk protection and safe passage on the lonesome Tibetan plateau would cement the Ilkhanate's position as the successor-state of the Great Khan and perhaps even secure the Dalai Lama's respect and endorsement." 
 ilk_gateway_title:0 "Gateway to India"
 ilk_gateway_desc: "Tibet was not an easy conquest, owing to its harsh climate and insular peoples. Further south, beyond the mighty Himalayas, lay Nepal and Kashmir, rich, bountiful and ripe pickings for our resurgent strength. Should we lay waste to the region, we may use the consolidated Himalayas as a gateway to greater India."
 ilk_maharajas_title:0 "Defeat the Maharajas"
 ilk_maharajas_desc: "The vast and sprawling lands of India, rich in wealth, blood and glory, lay in a shattered state. The foolish Maharajas seek to establish hegemonic power over the region, but to no avail. We shall introduce to these people our Khan's wisdom and in turn grant them a true Maharaja, in turn carrying out the dreams our forefathers could not achieve."
 ilk_capture_capital_title:0 "Capture the Old Capital"
 ilk_capture_capital_desc: "Qaraqorum sits as the ancestral home of our legacy. Once, the Great Khan rode out from its humble walls to conquer the world. To let it sit beyond our grasp is truly an insult to his name- for are we not the inheritors of his strength, his title, his wisdom? Qaraqorum and all of old Mongolia must be reclaimed."
 ilk_qaraqorum_title:0 "Rebuild Qaraqorum"
 ilk_qaraqorum_desc: "Qaraqorum stands neglected today, a lonely vestige of the old ways on a lonelier steppe. A city with such an important legacy, such a history, should not be unnoticeable to those humble travellers who pass it by. Its walls must stand mighty, its palaces must bustle and its merchants must be the most rich and industrious of the Silk Road, until it too can be seen as a city worthy of being called a capital, should we deem it so."
 ilk_festival_title:0 "Nadaam Festival"
 ilk_festival_desc: "With Qaraqorum under our wise rule, it stands unthinkable that the Nadaam Festival is forgotten and relegated to petty local recreations. A decannual festival of the Mongol people, it saw many a fierce young man participate in wrestling, archery and horsemanship. Not only did it bring people together, but it also introduced the youth to the cherished military traditions of our people and create many a potential warrior out of those once deemed unworthy."
 ilk_warlords_title:0 "The Middle Kingdom"
 ilk_warlords_desc: "The south of China has devolved into utter chaos. The decadent Mongol rulers who have been swept aside by our masterful hand have left us a truly awful mess to clean up. South of China is now filled with warlords that have fought against our rule for centuries and harm our legitimacy. This cannot do. We need to show the Chinese that resistance is futile and it is their eternal fate to serve under the Mongol Yoke."
 ilk_mongols_title:0 "Reuniting the Mongols"
 ilk_mongols_desc: "The Mongols today stand in a sorry state. They squabble with one another over the rule of China- torn between various strange faiths and philosophies, embittered by old family rivalries and peppered with sedentary decadence exuded by the Chinese peasantry they once dominated. Should we remind them of the old ways and teach them of our resurgent capacities, they will flock to our fold and Mongolia will become a heartland of our rising empire."
 ilk_nchina_title:0 "Reclaim North China"
 ilk_nchina_desc: "With Mongol loyalty secured, China's fertile, flat plains lay vulnerable. Should we sweep through this region, razing, ransacking and claiming what is ours, it will serve China a reminder of its place beneath our heel and embolden and educate our eager men in the ways of siege warfare- specifically, those against the cowardly cities of the so-called Middle Kingdom."
 ilk_manchuria_title:0 "Manchurian Incursion"
 ilk_manchuria_desc: "The Mongols are a proud and valuable asset, but we must not ignore their eastern neighbours and think ourselves overly secure and mighty. The peoples of Manchuria are a wise and fearsome steppe people much like us, with a wealth of manpower and resources we can utilise for further conquest. Furthermore, the unruly and tattered state of their leadership means any border shared with them is a fundamentally unsafe one- thus their loyalty is imperative."
 ilk_yam_title:0 "Restore the Yam"
 ilk_yam_desc: "The yam was a postal system and supply point route messenger system extensively used and expanded by Ogedei Khan and subsequent Great Khans. Following the Empire's collapse, the entire system also collapsed. With our wisdom and propserity, it shall be restored and elevate our power and efficiency to new heights."
 ilk_caucasia_title:0 "Rule Caucasia"
 ilk_caucasia_desc: "We would be foolish to ignore the mountain realm to our north. Should we capture Caucasia proper, not only would we gain a wealth of manpower from the bored and restless valley tribes, but also the vital mountain passes to the great steppe beyond."
 ilk_crimea_title:0 "Capture Crimea"
 ilk_crimea_desc: "Crimea stands as a vital cornerstone of trade at the far end of the Silk Road. While its petty riches and mercantile significance is appealing, its true worth to us is that of a base of military operations. Should we secure it, we could at last resume and carry out our well-deserved conquest of the rich and mysterious Europe." 
 ilk_yoke_title:0 "The Mongol Yoke"
 ilk_yoke_desc: "Ruthenia has submitted and at our feet stands many a petty kingdom in need of true overlordship. Let us extend our strength across these lost and misguided peasants and enrich our coffers with what resources they can muster."
 ilk_ruthenia_title:0 "Ruin Ruthenia"
 ilk_ruthenia_desc: "Centuries ago, we swept through Ruthenia and battered down the doors of the cowardly and feeble peasantry, coveting riches and goods rightfully ours. We have not forgotten this glorious conquest- but apparently the peasants of Ruthenia have, for they have erected of themselves silly little kingdoms oblivious of who their true rulers are, daring to mimic our traditions and mastery of the region's climate. Let us tear to shreds this insolent self-determination."
 ilk_sarai_title:0 "Capture Sarai"
 ilk_sarai_desc: "Our brethren to the north have made of themselves blundering fools. They find themselves disunited, pursuing strange faiths and devoid of all military competence. Let us teach them the way of the steppe, for they have surely forgotten it- and deprive them of the legendary and bountiful Sarai, founded by the Great Khan himself, who would surely balk at its current ownership."
 ilk_golden_horde_title:0 "Ulug Ulus"
 ilk_golden_horde_desc: "The Golden Horde was once a force to be feared. It invoked terror in the hearts of the steppe Christians and the Rus alike. Let us purge the last vestiges of its current pathetic leadership, restore its honour and claim the region for ourselves."
 ilk_raze_title:0 "Raze Rus' to the Ground"
 ilk_raze_desc: "The internal trouble within the Golden Horde created a power vacuum which was swiftly abused by the rebellious princedoms of Rus' who defied the Mongol rule. The time has come to put them in their place and inflict devastation so massive that even the Destruction of Kievan Rus' will pale in comparison to it." 
 ilk_mongol_empire_title:0 "Restore the Mongol Empire" 
 ilk_mongol_empire_desc: "From our humble, precarious position in Persia, we have swept across the former holdings of the Great Khan and restored our honour. For too long, the empire of Genghis Khan has laid fallen, broken into many parts. We must restore his legacy by replicating the Great Khan's conquests. We will reconquer the Mongol Empire!"

 ab_slavic_arkona_title:0 "Renovate Arkona" 
 ab_slavic_arkona_desc:0 "The most sacred site in all of Slavdom is the Holy Temple of Arkona, but compared to the grand cathedrals of the Christians, it is a bit underwhelming. Renovations and improved iconography will put us on par with the Christians and legitimize our claim to be the guardians of the faith to our people."
 ab_slavic_sites_title:0 "Control the Holy Sites" 
 ab_slavic_sites_desc:0 "The holy sites of our faith have been under control of numerous different tribes and statelets over the centuries, but this disorganized control has only weakened our faith to outsiders. Already the city of Kiev has fallen to the Christians, and the crusader states in the Baltic and Germany threaten these sacred places. It is up to us to guard these sites from heathens." 
 ab_slavic_reform_title:0 "Reform the Religion" 
 ab_slavic_reform_desc:0 "Times are changing, and the need to centralize our beliefs into a uniform code is becoming increasingly necessary when faced against the onslaught of missionaries from the Christian world. The creation of a central church hierarchy and a codified holy book will entrench the belief of Perun in our subjects, although our neighbors will have to be taught the new ways by force."

 pom_rival_veleti_title:0 "Rival Veleti" 
 pom_rival_veleti_desc:0 "The closest threat to the Duke is our rival the Veleti, and years of conflict and raids between our people have resulted in little to no changes in the border.

 bulgaria_antioch_desc:0 "Before 634 there existed a pentarchy of Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria that reigned as religious authority over Christendom. After 634 that pentarchy was reduced to two - Rome and Constantinople. Antioch was a city that served as one of the end points of Silkroad, being the center of wealth and trade unlike anything seen outside of Constantinople. Though it was not the main focus of the crusades the crusaders happened to reclaim the city. It is the nearest to Bulgaria, hence it ought to also be the easiest city to reclaim for our Faith."

Everything that was glorious about the city north of the ancient Persian capital is gone...\n\nBut that does not mean we can't start a new Golden Age.\n\nThe city, though not glorious, boasts a sizable population. This allows for a source of local workers and manpowers. We need to divert state funds towards rebuilding Baghdad into what it once was. We are obligated to bring beauty and glory back to Baghdad.

 byzantium_tripolitania_desc: "Tripolitania was once an incredibly wealthy and secure holding of Rome. The great Septimus Severus even hailed from the lost Leptis Magna, whom upon his ascension, made of the city a marvel on par with Carthage and Alexandria. Reclaiming the region will seal off the Mediterranean from vile southern barbarians and also make safe the vital cities which dot the arid coast."
 byzantium_carthago_title:0 "Carthago Delenda Est"
 byzantium_carthago_desc: "The Byzantine state has had a troubled relationship with Carthage. Long ago, the filthy marauding Vandals established a petty kingdom out of the ancient city. Arabs have seized it and other vital Mediterranean holdings to further their slavery and barbarism. Today, the city stands in a horrifying state- a capital of piracy and slavery operated by none other than Muslims. We must obliterate this den of sin and evil in the name of our resurrection."
 byzantium_sultanate_title:0 "Dissolve the Sultanate"
 byzantium_sultanate_desc: "Out of the once-proud island of Sicily, a heartland of Greece in its own right, Muslims have established a sultanate. What's worse, they have trespassed upon Italia itself, encroaching upon the very city from which our forefathers came, our beloved Rome. This transgression and their persistent existence calls for their immediate and total annihilation- and Christ Jesus shall see it."
 byzantium_pentarchy_title:0 "Restore the Pentarchy"
 byzantium_pentarchy_desc: "Not since the days of a fully united empire, over a thousand years ago now, have the patriarchs flown the same banners up on their towers. Should we restore the sacred pentarchy, restoring each and every comprising city to their rightful faith and divinity, the heretic and heathen worlds shall quiver before the resurgent phoenix's holy flame." 
 byzantium_heal_schism_title:0 "Mend the Schism"
 byzantium_heal_schism_desc: "A petty dispute in old days long past shattered the Kingdom of God in two halves - that of the Catholic West and the Orthodox East, or so they are referred to. If we were to elevate the restored pentarchy to a height and honour undeniable to the Catholic West, the truly pious and faithful shall flock to the gates of not only our empire, but His rightful church - that which dwells in Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch and the heart of every holy preacher in Europe who knows our glory." 
 byzantium_march_rome_title:0 "March on Rome"
 byzantium_march_rome_desc: "'The Eternal City'. 'Caput Mundi'. 'City of God'. Rome has had many a name. As we march to take back the city, however, there are but four words that echo in the mind of every true son of Rome. 'Nostra Civitas'. Our city. 'Cor Nostrum'. Our heart."
 byzantium_isles_title:0 "Conquer the Isles"
 byzantium_isles_desc: "The assorted islands of Italia were once seen as backwaters, insignifcant and irrelevant to the empire. However, in our current situation and the new balance of power in the Mediterranean, the islands find themselves vital stepping stones. We must reclaim them to further our advance."
 byzantium_wmed_title:0 "Rule West Mediterranean"
 byzantium_wmed_desc: "The Balearic Islands have fallen to the Muslim stranglehold and find themselves contested bitterly between petty powers. If we were to wrest them from their filthy grasp, we would assert dominance over the waters of the Mediterranean's western half with ease."
 byzantium_iron_title:0 "Claim the Iron Crown"
 byzantium_iron_desc: "Northern Italia fancies itself a loose mess of independent imbeciles, deluded duchies and babbling buffoons, swimming in more undeserved wealth and squandered manpower than they know what to do with. Crushing this sad state of disunity by smothering the peninsula's remaining vestiges of power and sovereignity will signal to the world who the true masters of Italia are."
 byzantium_italy_title:0 "Triumph for Italy"
 byzantium_italy_desc: "For the first time in centuries, all of Italia lays at our feet, crying out for our dominance and reclamation. We must extend our power to the very limits of the peninsula and restore the glory of Rome proper across our former heartland."
 byzantium_berber_title:0 "Subjugate the Berbers"
 byzantium_berber_desc: "The entirety of our history in Africa has been plagued by the Berber threat. The local tribes have always been a thorn in our side, but clever manipulation and bargaining have done well to placate and swindle their masses. Now, however, they have organised themselves into silly sultanates- meaning we must march into the heat of the Maghreb to show them their true place."
 byzantium_barbary_title:0 "Control the Barbary Coast"
 byzantium_barbary_desc: "Not only have the Berbers deluded themselves into self-rule, but they have also laid waste to peaceful and idyllic Christian shorelines across the Mediterranean with barbaric pirate raids. If we were to fully dominate the coastline, we would cut the Berbers off from the sea for good- and all of Europe would surely benefit."
 byzantium_maghreb_title:0 "Triumph for Africa"
 byzantium_maghreb_desc: "Pockets of resistance remain across the Maghreb. We must crush these not only to proclaim our absolute dominance of Africa, but also enrich our coffers and economy with the luscious goods of the Berber mountain havens."
 byzantium_odyssey_title:0 "The Third Odyssey"
 byzantium_odyssey_desc: "With the Maghreb under our wing, we have acquired access to the Atlantic. Ancient thinkers and mappers alike spoke of strange lands beyond the Pillars of Hercules- now, in recent years, we have learned that a new world most certainly awaits us across the Atlantic, where we can send irritating foreign troublemakers, aspiring young conquerors and fearsome hardy homesteaders by the thousands to establish a new Rome. A new Odyssey awaits the bravest of Roman hearts."
 byzantium_andalusia_title:0 "Invade Andalusia"
 byzantium_andalusia_desc: "The proud land of Hispania has fallen to a foul Muslim horde. The humble Latin once spoken by the natives has almost been entirely eroded, save for the desperate northern enclaves. We must shatter the heathen hold over Hispania and deal a killing blow to the ailing Muslim rule to free the peninsula's people."
 byzantium_iberia_title:0 "Triumph for Iberia"
 byzantium_iberia_desc: "With the Muslims sorely wounded by our efforts, Hispania lays vulnerable to our advance. We must embrace the peninsula in its entirety and restore Roman rule across its war-torn valleys. The beaten and bloodied Christians of Hispania cry out for a unifier- and that unifier is Rome."
 byzantium_arelat_title:0 "Arelat Conquest"
 byzantium_arelat_desc: "The wealthy holdings of Eastern Gaul have found themselves in a state of squabbling for centuries now, fought over by the pretentious princes of Germania and the foolhardy Franks. Sweeping through these so-called independent powers will provide us a gateway to Gaul proper."
 byzantium_dethrone_title:0 "Overthrow the Carolingians"
 byzantium_dethrone_desc: "The prosperous and bountiful former province of Gaul is in no sorry state- the foundations our ancestors laid in this vital land have lasted, so it seemed, so well that the barbaric Franks and their petty descendents have thrived. The Carolingians as of late however have proven to be nothing but trouble for the humble peasants of the province and worse, even style themselves as Emperors of Rome. Let us snuff this pathetic assertation and remove this insipid dynasty from Gaul forever."
 byzantium_alpine_title:0 "March Across the Alps"
 byzantium_alpine_desc: "Helvetia, as the region encompassing the mighty Alps was once called, was a place as integral to Italia as Rome itself, many centuries ago. Not only did it serve as a vital defensive buffer, but also as a propserous and booming region in its own right under Pax Romana. Under our resurgent strength, the peasants and farmers of Helvetica may once more enjoy our benevolent rule and guidance- and more importantly, serve as a stepping stone into Germania."
 byzantium_rhine_title:0 "The Rhenish Border"
 byzantium_rhine_desc: "It cannot be denied- Germania is a wild, dangerous heartland of barbaric peoples. This truth is evident today more than ever. To guard against this formidable threat, we must re-establish Germania Inferior, a vital and historical defensive province and subsequently, an announcement to the divided Europa of our imminent supremacy."
 byzantium_restoration_title:0 "Imperial Restoration"
 byzantium_restoration_desc: "Roman rule collapsed swiftly in Britannia as the fall came upon us. The province prospered beneath and after our reign, however- that cannot be denied. The settled Germanic peoples have since utilised our infrastructure and guidance to fashion of Britannia splendid kingdoms and institutions. Today, we see a culture in vital need of new guidance and protection- and an estranged province in dire need of a most imperial restoration."
 byzantium_suez_title:0 "The Suez Canal"
 byzantium_suez_desc: "The merchants and seafarers of Egypt have come to us with an interesting proposal. If we were to carve through the dry, dire Suez a canal of gargantuan proportions, we could in theory create a canal linking the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, circumventing all of the deserts and jungles of Africa in one fell swoop. This would not only enrich our coffers, but give us a vital edge over our seafaring rivals- as well as announce to the world our taming and moulding of Tellus Mater herself." 
 byzantium_reform_imperial_army_title:0 "Reform the Imperial Army"
 byzantium_reform_imperial_army_desc:0 "While we have procured many a mighty general throughout our tired and ailing history fending off the heathens of the east, the imperial army leaves much to be desired in this brave new age. Europa's petty duchies and squabbling kingdoms have made of themselves fine martial educators and warriors with the wealth and prosperity they hoard. It is time we catch up and show to the world Rome's true capabilities and military might."
 byzantium_unrivaled_title:0 "The Unrivaled Phoenix"
 byzantium_unrivaled_desc: "The phoenix that is our reborn empire burns brighter than the sun. The world trembles before our power. Our coffers are the envy of Europa and the peace our provinces enjoy is unmatched. Let us make of our empire a fighting force the world has not yet seen- and cement Rome's name in history as unrivalled, unmatched and undefeated, forevermore. "

 rum_muslim_janissary_desc:0 "In the Turkish realm, the highest honor that any heathen can have bestowed upon him is to be conscripted as a Janissary. These elite soldiers exclusively come from non-Muslim families who hold no land, ensuring their absolute loyalty to the Sultan alone, who makes of them his own sons."
 rum_muslim_pashas_desc:0 "As our sultanate grows, so too does the need for bureaucracy. We can't afford to invest too much of our resources into bureaucracy or else we might suffer from the underfunding of more meaningful bodies of the sultanate. Pashas - military governors - may be our solution to the bureaucracy problem. Let us create new pashas from our military men, and turn them into proper governors of our lands."
 rum_muslim_discipline_desc:0 "The Turkmen in our armies have always been rowdier and harder to control than our slave-soldiers. With the practice of slavery becoming increasingly frowned upon in the Muslim world, it would serve us well to discipline our own men so that they may fight with the same level of unity as other armies."

 rum_muslim_baghdad_desc:0 "Baghdad is a city of great prestige, yet of little true value beyond that.

To conquer Baghdad, one does not need a justification beyond that of returning the once prosperous city to what it once was."
 rum_muslim_house_desc:0 "The mere thought of what Baghdad was, and how it was desecrated by the Mongols, brings tears to any Muslim scholar. The very city that signified the existence of the Islamic Golden Age has fallen into disrepair. None of the scientific marvels survived the sacking. Everything that was glorious about the city north of the ancient Persian capital is gone...\n\nBut that does not mean we can't start a new Golden Age.\n\nThe city, though not glorious, boasts a sizable population. This allows for a source of local workers and manpower. We need to divert state funds towards rebuilding Baghdad into what it once was and are obligated to bring beauty and glory back to it.

 rum_muslim_caliphate_desc:0 "The Abbasids may be too weak to assert control over Islam. They have lived for far too long in a gilded cage, dwelling within the halls of Cairo. For Islam to reclaim its golden age, it needs to be lead by a nation that is entering its own golden age.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a strong nation, with a mighty military tradition.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a nation of great virtue.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age, then, it needs to be lead by us.\n\nLet us proclaim the Rumi Caliphate!"
 rum_muslim_egypt_desc:0 "Our Sultan has but one word to describe the Nizzarids:\n\nPathethic.\n\nThey are only a bunch of writhing worms claiming to be a nation of greatness, while there is nothing great about them. They have lost Syria to us, and have been unable to reclaim the holy land while we were the first to succeed at it completely. They are unfit to rule over Egypt.

Should we attempt to convert them to the true faith, or continue the longstanding Muslim tradition of Tolerance and special protection for the Dhimmi?"
 rum_muslim_sword_desc:0 "In order to cement our dedication to the defense of our faith, we shall pledge to all our brothers of true Islam that should any infidel encroach on them, we will come to their defense as a matter of principle.

Our northern border is a highly coveted land by them - yet, at times, pragmatism has to take precedence over old friendships. It’s necessary for us to take control over Syria and make use of its massive population as our newest cannon fodder."
 seljuk_palestine_title:0 "Liberate Palestine"
 seljuk_palestine_desc:0 "Palestine shall be cleansed from the Crusader taint. One of our holy sites has been under infidel control for too long. It is a duty of all Muslim nations to reclaim it and purify it of its Christian disease, and yet, so far, it would seem to be unfulfilled. It shall fall upon Seljuk hands to liberate Palestine from the darkness of the infidels."
 seljuk_cities_title:0 "Custodian of the Holy Cities"
 seljuk_cities_desc:0 "Second only to the Caliphate in worthiness is the Custodianship of the Holy Cities. It is the second most prestigious title any Muslim nation can hope to hold to itself. We should make the protection of the holy sites our duty."
 seljuk_gulf_title:0 "Secure the Gulf"
 seljuk_gulf_desc:0 "Basra was not the last port to fall under our control, nor was it enough to entirely sway trade under our heel. We need to extend our dominance over the Persian Gulf by making all of its Arabic coast part of our growing empire. It is the only way to fully dominate trade."
 seljuk_sands_title:0 "Sands of Arabia"
 seljuk_sands_desc:0 "Brave, free, and hard to control: these are some of the words one might use to describe the Bedouins of the Arab desert. They move where they please, which makes any subjugation of the tribes hard. Though it will be costly, we need to sway them onto our side - either diplomatically or through war. Then, once that is completed, all of Arabia is finally going to be united as in the days of the Islamic Golden Age."
 seljuk_egypt_title:0 "Overthrow the Nizzarids"
 seljuk_egypt_desc:0 "Our Sultan has but one word to describe the Nizzarids:\n\nPathethic.\n\nThey are only a bunch of writhing worms claiming to be a nation of greatness, while there is nothing great about them. They have lost Syria to us, and have been unable to reclaim the holy land while we were the first to succeed at it completely. They are unfit to rule over Egypt. From the Persians to Romans, the Caliphates to the Ayyubids, Egypt's fate has been sealed: they are only fit as subjects of a mighty empire."
 seljuk_caliphate_title:0 "Seljuk Caliphate"
 seljuk_caliphate_desc:0 "The Abbasids may be too weak to assert control over Islam. They have lived for far too long in a gilded cage, dwelling within the halls of Cairo. For Islam to reclaim its golden age, it needs to be lead by a nation that is entering its own golden age.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a strong nation, with a mighty military tradition.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age it needs to be lead by a nation of great virtue.\n\nFor Islam to reclaim its golden age, then, it needs to be lead by us.\n\nLet us proclaim the Seljuk Caliphate!"
 seljuk_city_title:0 "City of the World's Desire"
 seljuk_city_desc:0 "If Constantinople is truly the City of the World's Desire, it would be wrong for it not to share its splendor with the rest of the world. It has hoarded its glory for far too long. It is, perhaps, a good time for the wealth and glory of Constantinople to be shared amongst the future owners of it: the Seljuk Turks."
 seljuk_nicaea_title:0 "Bulwark of Christianity"
 seljuk_nicaea_desc:0 "Is this the best Christendom has to offer? Pathetic. They hold nothing of importance, being but a roadstop before Constantinople. We should end its miserable existence and just get on with our conquest."
 seljuk_persepolis_title:0 "Sack Persepolis" 
 seljuk_persepolis_desc:0 "Persepolis has fallen, and yet it is still standing. That is not quite right and should be rectified. The last of the ancient, mighty capitals will soon enter the history books as merely another dead city!"
 seljuk_iran_title:0 "Reforge the Seljuk Empire"
 seljuk_iran_desc:0 "Centuries ago, our ancestors brought the mighty Mihranid Empire to its knees and the entirety of Eranshahr briefly fell under the Seljuk yoke. Now as the Ilkhanate has fallen and princes of Persia fight for control of Iran, it is time we march in and subjugate them once again, before they are able to recover their strength."
 seljuk_fate_title:0 "Fate of Persia"
 seljuk_fate_desc:0 "We have done it - Iran is no more an independent nation. It has finally fallen under the control of an Islamic realm. Its conversion to Islam is now inevitable. The Light of Allah has finally come to Iran.\n\nYet there remains one question, one puzzling question that we are not quite sure as to how we should answer:\n\nwhat should be done with the Iranian culture?"
 seljuk_khorasan_title:0 "Push into Khorasan"
 seljuk_khorasan_desc:0 "We have already pushed far deeper than any other Caliphate has, but that does not mean we should stop here. Instead we should push further east! Last time someone from the edge of Europe waged a path of war eastward, they went to the banks of India. If we ought to ensure our position in the Islamic history as the greatest Islamic realm we have to push even further, until we reach the Indus River ourselves.\n\nFirst, however, we need to conquer Khorasan from the middle. It won't be easy due to the plentiful mountain ranges, but it is still something we have to do."
 seljuk_kirthar_title:0 "Reach Kirthar"
 seljuk_kirthar_desc:0 "India is in our sight, yet it is not yet in our grasp. There are still a few dangerous mountains in the middle. Our armies are getting slowly exhausted and devastated from the delays in the mountains, but it will soon be repaid once we reach the lowlands and jungles of India. We have only to reach Kirthar now."
 seljuk_indian_trade_title:0 "Control Indian Trade"
 seljuk_indian_trade_desc:0 "We have done it! We have finally reached India. We are at the threshold of surpassing Alexander's conquests in the east. However, it would be foolish to care about conquest alone. India is a wealthy subcontinent, and we should put attention towards steering this wealth towards our heartlands in the west. We need to lay claims and control over the many central regions of India, if we wish to have a piece of the mercantile wealth that India has."

When our ancestors left the steppes of Asia for the various homelands, they found themselves in, they lost that connection with one another, and became separate and weak. Under the leadership of our glorious leader, we have managed to unite our people under a singular banner.

 seljuk_westindia_desc:0 "Rajasthan, as it is called, is a land of epic battles and legendary warlords.

They will be put to the sword all the same."

 seljuk_turan_horde_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the ancient Turkic Khaganate, many powers sought to dominate the steppe, but none were more successful than the Mongols, whose remnants remain some of the most powerful states even now. Among them is the Golden Horde, our fiercest rival, whose people will soon learn the treachery of their idolatry."
 selkuk_turan_asia_desc:0 "'Turan' is a word used by Turks throughout the world to describe the greater sphere of Turkish peoples. Never before could they have dreamed that one day, this fantasy state would become a reality - but under our Great Sultan we have shown that, by the grace of God, all things are possible."
 seljuk_devshirme_desc:0 "The Devshirme system has served us well, but conscription from dhimmi provinces exclusively has our fighting reserves running short. Perhaps it is time to begin conscripting young men of the true faith as well. The Ghazi Sultan would do well to have warriors of the faith in his host."
 seljuk_janissary_desc:0 "In the Seljuk realm, the highest honor that any heathen can have bestowed upon him is to be conscripted as a Janissary. These elite soldiers exclusively come from non-Muslim families who hold no land, ensuring their absolute loyalty to the Sultan alone, who makes of them his own sons."
 seljuk_sipahi_desc:0 "The importance of cavalry to our history cannot be understated. It was our elite cavalry archers that won us our new homeland at Manzikert. By creating elite cavalry regiments, we can instill with a charge of horses the same terror that we once struck into the heart of the Roman Emperor himself."
 seljuk_russina_subjects:0 "With the Golden Horde swept aside, in order to ensure a power vacuum does not arise in Russia we must restore the authority they once had over the Rus - but with ourselves at the helm instead."
 seljuk_tunisia_desc:0 "With Egypt consolidated, the lands of Tunisia are prime for conquest. Their trading cities will further increase the influence of the Sultanate over the Mediterranean."
 seljuk_maghreb_desc:0 "The lands of the Maghreb have been independent from the Abbasid Caliphate for centuries. With our new state established, we shall make them subjects of a Caliph once more."
 seljuk_andalusia_desc:0 "The last obstacle in the way of our restoration of Dar-al-Islam is the so called 'Caliphate' of Andalusia. The Umayyads have always been treacherous, and with righteousness on our side we will strike down these idolaters."
 seljuk_arab_tradition_desc:0 "With the Arabs making up an increasingly high percentage of our population, the aristocracy of the Sultanate have begun speaking a new language. 'Seljuk Turkish', as it is called, blends the traditional calligraphy and vernacular of Arabic with the mother tongue of the Sultan, creating ease of communication and a flourishing of literature."
 seljuk_bridging_desc:0 "With our borders expanding, we would do well to create a system of roads not unlike that which the Romans once paved, to foster the transport of goods and peoples throughout our lands."
 seljuk_caravan_desc:0 "Our homeland in the steppe was at a vital crossroads of the Silk Road; we, more than any other people, understand the importance of caravansaries to the speed and ease of trade."

 seljuk_faith_desc:0 "The Ghazi Sultan is faced with a decision. Though we have always been righteous defenders of the faith, the status of the Dhimmi has become a subject of debate among the Ulema. Should we attempt to convert them to the true faith, or continue the longstanding Muslim tradition of Tolerance and special protection for the Dhimmi?"
 seljuk_commemorate_desc:0 "Centuries ago the Ghazi Sultan Alp Arslan defeated the Romans at Manzikert, paving the way for Turkish control of Anatolia. This momentous occasion deserves a monument to its memory, and to the bravery of Alp Arslan and his men."
 seljuk_diwan_desc:0 "The supreme Diwan is the governing body of our state, but with the width of our holdings becoming increasingly unwieldy, it is apparent that we must reform our system of governance to accommodate greater lands more efficiently."
 seljuk_gunpowder_desc:0 "The Turkomans have always been pioneers of artillery fire, and their early adoption of gunpowder should serve as a model for our army's own artillery wing. Our cannons will be lighter, faster, and more powerful."
 seljuk_pride_desc:0 "The pride of our Sultan has always been our elite infantry units. These companies have been molded over time from the unorganized shock troops of nomadic Turkic armies into a highly disciplined force, the very model of modern military professionalism."
 seljuk_discipline_desc:0 "The Turkmen in our armies have always been rowdier and harder to control than our slave-soldiers.

 geo_pass_title:0 "Fortify the Darial Gorge"
 geo_pass_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the Darial Gorge has been a gateway for northern barbarian incursions. War after war has reduced the ancient fortifications of the Gates of Alan, rumoured to have been erected by Alexander of Macedon himself, to cluttered brickwork and dishevelled peasants. The defences are in dire need of revitalisation."
 geo_fortify_title:0 "Fortress Caucasia"
 geo_fortify_desc:0 "Our lands have time and time again been threatened by heathen expansion, barbaric wrath and the ill-gotten conquest of foreigners. More than ever, we must transform our docile peasantry's mountainous abodes into conscription centres and castle complexes. The bones of every foolhardy conqueror will be ground to dust against our hallowed peaks."
 geo_ciscaucasia_title:0 "Dominate North Caucasus"
 geo_ciscaucasia_desc:0 "The Alans had proven themselves time and time again to be incapable not only of defending and maintaining the word of Christ, but also protecting their own holdings. Furthermore, wild Cuman horsemen sit to our northeast, amassing numbers. To protect our interests, we must incorporate these untamed lands into our realm and establish a perimeter against greater threats."
 geo_ilkhanate_title:0 "Bane of the Ilkhan"
 geo_ilkhanate_desc:0 "The Ilkhanate, once proud and formidable, has been brought to its knees and reduced to a laughable enclave. Its perservering existence is an insult to the men of old who bled until death to ensure our independence. We must obliterate them while they are downtrodden and thus earn us a gateway to the lucrative Caspian Sea."
 geo_sarukhanids_title:0 "The Sarukhan Plague"
 geo_sarukhanids_desc:0 "Of all of our neighbours, the most foul of them all is not necessarily the most threatening. The Sarukhanids, as they go by, are an odd bundle of Seljuqs who have adopted Zoroaster's delusions and parade its subsequent horrors across Anatolia. Our first step in rectifying our sorry western frontier is bringing about their immediate extinction."
 geo_crimea_title:0 "Control Theodoro"
 geo_crimea_desc:0 "Under the strange proclamations, decrees and excesses of the Romans, Goths have crowded the peninsula of Crimea and founded an enclave prone towards idolatory, gleeful submission to barbaric interests and trade with the greedy and treasonous west. Not only is their existence a blight against Christ, but also an irritating sore crowding a point of strategic interest. Annexing them would earn us an upper-hand in the Sea of Speri."
 geo_trebizond_title:0 "Liberate Trebizond"
 geo_trebizond_desc:0 "The Greeks of Trebizond, steadfast and worthy followers of Christ, face brutal and scathing oppression beneath the Seljuqs, who proclaim themselves lords of Anatolia and a scourge of the righteous Lord's word. If we were to secure the Pontic Alps, not only would we free our brothers in faith, but so would we secure a foothold in Turkish Anatolia."
 geo_blacksea_title:0 "The Black Sea Trade"
 geo_blacksea_desc:0 "With the Sea of Speri secured, we must exploit our newfound influence to its fullest potential. For centuries, barbarians, heretics, Romans and worst of all, Italian traders, have greedily coveted the spoils of the so-called 'Black Sea'. We must establish mercantile domination."
 geo_overthrow_title:0 "Overthrow the Golden Horde"
 geo_overthrow_desc:0 "Our newfound northern dominions will fall swiftly if we do not ward off the pestilence which roams the northern steppe- the Golden Horde. We must shatter the Tatar grip over the region once and for all and drive them back into the accursed plains from which they came."
 geo_convert_title:0 "Baptize the Steppes"

 geo_sarai_title:0 "Sack Sarai"
 geo_sarai_desc:0 "Sarai, sitting on the eastern side of the Akhtuba river, is the long-standing capitol of the Mongol foreigners and a den of heathen traders, false prophets and strange customs. To wreak upon it equal havoc and destruction its horse lords wrought upon the world is God's will. Sarai shall burn and the steppe shall tremble at the mention of our name."
 geo_caspian_title:0 "The Caspian Fleet"

 geo_seljuk_title:0 "Seljuk Heartland"
 geo_seljuk_desc:0 "The Turks have foolishly settled and allowed their sheep to graze in a land not quite their own. We are willing to overlook this transgression should their overlords be slaughtered and relieved of their holdings.

 geo_roman_title:0 "Claim the Roman Throne"
 geo_roman_desc:0 "Time and time again, our ancestors lived through the same tale- Roman betrayal and subsequently, foreign conquest and exploitation.

Let us claim Constantinople in an act of both righteous revenge and piety."
 geo_cilicia_title:0 "Safeguard Cilicia"
 geo_cilicia_desc:0 "The Armenians are another misguided, foolish sect of Christ who seek to twist the good word and make a mockery of it- yet, they are our persecuted brethren nonetheless and will make worthy subjects.

 geo_nicaea_title:0 "Conquer Nicaea"

However, the Roman decline has allowed barbarians and worse, Latin marauders, to sweep through the Balkans, threatening the wealth of knowledge and devotion that is Greece.

 geo_golden_title:0 "The Second Golden Age"
 geo_golden_desc:0 "The peasants were like nobles, the nobles like princes, and the princes like kings," - so they said of us. Through our long lost golden age centuries ago, Georgia was a pinnacle of stability and freedom from not only unjust horror, but also heathen and Turkish oppression. In these times, the Romans themselves considered us a wise and fearsome power to lean on and our piety in pilgrimages was unmatched. Let us reclaim our honour and restore stability, improve our prestige and develop our lands to new heights."
 geo_agriculture_title:0 "Invest in the Agriculture"
 geo_agriculture_desc:0 "While trade is a vital necessity, we must bolster and strengthen our centres of agriculture. Our position, surrounded by marauding heathens and flagrant barbarism, calls for self-reliance and self-determination. We must improve our farmland until it is the envy of the region and famine becomes but a distant memory."
 geo_revive_title:0 "Revive Native Literature"
 geo_revive_desc:0 "Over the centuries, our people have perused three scripts of our own marvellous cultivation- Asomtavruli, Nuskhuri and Mkhedruli. Mkhedruli finds itself the script of the land, exempt and separate from the sancticity of church- and that is the script that we shall tout high, build upon and make widespread among our educated and noble elite. Throughout Caucasia, our tongue and writing must spread."
 geo_cities_title:0 "Cities of Georgia"
 geo_cities_desc:0 "Our positioning among arid, inhospitable and ruthless mountains grants us undeniable defensive superiority, but it must be confessed that as a result, our urban development is not what it should be.

 geo_gelati_title:0 "Rebuild Gelati"
 geo_gelati_desc:0 "In 1106 AD, our proud forefather King David the Builder erected the most holy Gelati; a beautiful, gilded monastery of Christ, serving as a centre of learning and science. Not only is it a place most holy, but a serene, vital crossroads for aspiring Georgian thinkers and theologians. During its height, people referred to its majestic sprawl as "a new Hellas"- and we must make it one again."

Our revenge begins with insubordination- and insubordination begins now."
 cmn_sack_title: "Capture Sarai"
 cmn_sack_desc: "The hardest and most crucial victory lays right before our noses- the capture and destruction of Sarai. The foul city was erected by the dreadful Mongol Batu Khan as his riders swept through the steppe. To capture it and its adjacent plains will mark the beginning of the end of Mongol hegemony."
 cmn_legacy_title: "Legacy of the Steppe"

 cmn_coalition_title: "Anti-Mongol Coalition"
 cmn_coalition_desc: "Mongol strength over the steppe is waning. In the twilight of their hegemony, we would be fools not to find allies in fellow Mongol subjects and victims. All around the diminishing Mongol yoke, a vengeful thirst for blood grows- and we must foster and direct it."
 cmn_rule_steppe_title: "Restore Rule Over the Steppe"
 cmn_rule_steppe_desc: "With a crushing blow dealt to the Mongols, one of our crucial former holdings lays just beyond our grasp- the Pontic Steppe. These vital lands were once an oasis of tribute and facilitated fantastic trade with the Black Sea. Let us educate the current inhabitants of who their rightful rulers are."
 cmn_dismantle_title: "Bane of the Khan"
 cmn_dismantle_desc: "At long last, the dreaded Golden Horde has been fractured. Our true vengeance is at hand. To secure the steppe and protect Cumania forevermore, every province that dares fly a banner of the Golden Mongol Horde must burn and yield to Cumania, until they are mere soot on our soles."
 cmn_central_asia_title: "Cuman Restoration"
 cmn_central_asia_desc: "Our brave young riders and starry-eyed children have long been told tales of a time when Cumania stretched from the banks of Azov to the icy shores of the Irtysh. Now, their disbelief will make way for pride and triumph, as we reclaim that fateful eastern heartland. So too does the sun rise in the east- so too will Cumania rise once again."
 cmn_adopt_title: "Adopt Mongol Army Tactics"
 cmn_adopt_desc: "Though we hold contempt for our fallen enemies, we must pay respect where it is due- their ways were ferocious and their tenacity admirable. To enrich our own military knowledge and absorb the Tatar population of the steppe, we must learn Mongol wisdom so that their foul cruelty never sweeps Cumania again."
 cmn_alania_title: "Defeat the Alans"
 cmn_alania_desc: "The Alans have always been one of many little thorns in our feet. At the height of our power, they oftentimes recognised our might and either paid tribute or joined our armies. As of late, they lay in a similar desperate state to us and have devolved into conspiracy with the Georgians. They even dare eye our lands hungrily. We must strike first and put them in their place."
 cmn_army_title: "Recover Strength"
 cmn_army_desc: "We are surrounded on all sides by enemies. The Mongols mass in the north, the Alans hatch strange Christian plots in the west and the Georgians seek to establish an empire across the Caucasus. Let us rise to prominence and dissuade any who dare suppose we are weak."
 cmn_georgia_title: "Conquer Georgia"
 cmn_georgia_desc: "With the north of the Caucasus secured, we would be fools to ignore the threat laying beyond the mountain gates. The Georgians, zealous mountain Christians, pose a worthy threat from within their sturdy castles. Given some firm persuasion, however, we feel they could make excellent subjects."
 cmn_crimea_title: "Capture Crimea"
 cmn_crimea_desc: "Crimea was once a prized possession of Cumania. It granted us access to the vast Black Sea, a gateway to the strange Christian heartlands. If we were to reclaim this vital land and return it to the fold of our coastal khans, Cuman mercantile domination would surely make a return."
 cmn_qifjaq_title: "Trading City of Qifjaq"
 cmn_qifjaq_desc: "Qifjaq, not too long ago, was a vital city of Cumania. To this day, it remains a vital link between Europe and the Silk Road. Should we elevate the city to new heights, we could attract untold scores of merchants to its ports, thus restoring it as a fabulous and booming slave hub." 
 cmn_azov_title: "Seize Azov"
 cmn_azov_desc: "The city of Azov sits on the beating vein that is the Don River. Should we secure the city and the surrounding provinces, we could establish around the Don a perimeter against the Christian west- who find themselves worryingly unaware of the legend of Cumania and the might of the Cuman khans."
 cmn_ruthenia_title: "Invade Ruthenia"
 cmn_ruthenia_desc: "Ruthenia, as it is called, stands as a wealthy new prospective arm of Cumania. Its Christian inhabitants seem quite mortified by our presence, so we should best demonstrate the benefits of our rule and use them as a stepping stone for greater conquests into Europe's interior."

 cmn_yoke_desc: "Our ancestors, with ease, extracted tribute from our weak and ailing neighbours in exchange for mutual cooperation and respect. Many tribes of Cumania call for us to protect our neighbours, all the while extracting tribute like the days of old. If we were to spearhead a new array of permanent tributaries, Cumania would overflow with riches." 
 cmn_romania_title: "Subjugate the Romanians"
 cmn_romania_desc: "The Romanians, as they call themselves, hug the ancient foothills of the Carpathians, fancying themselves pious warriors of their strange god. Not only would they make fearsome and loyal warriors under our wise guidance, a subjugated Romania would also give way to interior Carpathia itself."
 cmn_bulgaria_title: "Destroy Bulgaria"
 cmn_bulgaria_desc: "The Bulgarians fancy themselves a new fledgling empire and a pinnacle of martial honour, forgetting our shared steppe heritage. Not only does a free Bulgar state pose a danger to Cumania, but so do the untamed Balkans, which, unchecked, are prone to fostering dangerous Christian rivals. This must be corrected."
 cmn_blood_title: "Blood of the Romans"
 cmn_blood_desc: "For as long as we can remember, the Romans have imposed their strange ways upon all within their grasp while cowardly flocking behind the walls of their cities. Now, they find themselves downtrodden. The city of the world's desire, Constantinople, isolate among fools, implores a worthy power to claim it- and that power is Cumania."
 cmn_carpathia_title: "Unite with the Magyars"
 cmn_carpathia_desc: "As the Mongols fell upon our heartland, our people, as well as many other steppe folk, fled across the world. Some became mercenaries. Some, like us, fled to the Caucasus. Others dashed west... and amidst the Carpathians, they sit lonely to this day, falling to Christian lies and pretenses. Let us bring them into our fold and restore our honour."

Once the dominant Mongol state in the region the tables have turned in our favour and we now hold the power to destroy the remaining khanate territories at will. Let us humiliate the Khan and demonstrate to him the traditional martial prowess of the Goths."
 feo_fleet_title:0 "Construct a Fleet"
 feo_fleet_desc:0 "While our ancestors might have marched across Europe on foot, times have changed.

It is time to build a grand Gothic fleet and to become a major naval power."

 feo_caucasia_title:0 "Safeguard Ciscaucasia"
 feo_caucasia_desc:0 "The lands of Northern Caucasus must be secured and be brought under Gothic control. As an important defense line against enemies on both sides due to the mountainous region, it would not be wise to let our enemies seize control of this region."
 feo_black_title:0 "Control the Black Sea"

 feo_empire_title:0 "Invade the Empire"
 feo_empire_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is nothing but a decentralised feudal mess. The Germanic peoples need a strong guiding hand not a federal feudal elective monarchy that is constantly at war with itself. This is enough reason for us the launch a massive invasion of the empire."
 feo_adriatic_title:0 "Access the Adriatic"

 glh_churches_title:0 "Build the Churches"
 glh_churches_desc:0 "In adopting this new religion, it has become clear that our converts lack houses of worship and priests lack buildings to administer teachings from. Let us raise our own churches across the land to help further the cause of the missionaries, and spread the faith."
 glh_metropolitans_title:0 "Raise Metropolitans"
 glh_metropolitans_desc:0 "One of the most distinguished ecclesiastical jurisdictions is that of the Metropolitan.

 glh_value_title:0 "Spread Islamic Values"
 glh_value_desc:0 "With our conversion to Islam, the scholars of the Muslim world that have flocked to our court have encouraged us to begin a campaign of conversion to bring the light of Allah to the many heathens of our realm. The non-Muslims who remain at court, however, have argued that they should be exempt from repressive conversion and have stated they are willing to adopt the status of Dhimmi. Whatever we decide, we must do so quickly to affirm the status of Islam and other faiths within the Golden Horde."
 glh_mosques_title:0 "Raise Mosques"

 glh_sponsor_title:0 "Sponsor the Scholars"
 glh_sponsor_desc:0 "One of the greatest values in Islam is that of knowledge and learning. Many kings have sponsored religious scholars to live at their court and conduct their teachings and analysis of Islam for the realm to follow. As a prominent and newly converted Muslim state, it would reflect well upon us to sponsor our own Muslim scholar and dedicated ourselves to his teachings."
 glh_teachings_budhda_title:0 "Teachings of Buddha"
 glh_teachings_budhda_desc:0 "The Buddhism we have become acquainted with, Vajrayana Buddhism, is very focused on the fact that one cannot achieve enlightenment through lone study, but through teachers and practice. It is important that we send forth teachers to the corners of the Empire to spread the word of Buddha."
 glh_monastic_title:0 "Construct Temples"
 glh_monastic_desc:0 "Temples are not necessarily required for Buddhist worship, though many monarchs spend much of the state's resources on constructing some of the most impressive temple complexes in the world.

With many new converts, it seems only fitting that we erect our own monumental temples to be renowned for the rest of time."

Their technological advancement has made them increasingly threatening over the centuries. Now that we are breaking into the world of European politics as a player and not a mere observer, we must ensure that we are taken seriously from a technological and scholarly perspective. We will embrace western military tactics and some aspects of their culture if it means we will have a seat at the table."
 glh_embrace_feudalism_desc:0 "The organization of our state has remained largely unchanged since the breakup of the Mongol Empire. Tribal leaders and clans still exert a significant amount of control over political affairs, and especially military operations. This decentralization cannot be allowed to continue if we want our nation to survive. It's time to truly get off the horse and establish a real government."
 glh_faith_question_desc:0 "The Golden Horde stands at the crossroads of many religions. To the east are the Orthodox Christians; to the north, the Islamic Volga Bulgars. Our own people are divided between devotees to the Buddha and followers of our ancient tradition venerating Tengri, the sky lord. Religious diversity among our population is fine, but with increasing tension within our leadership regarding our faith, it seems like the Khan will have to explicitly endorse one faith for the purpose of unity."
 glh_stabilize_desc:0 "The rebellious lords at the periphery of the Ulus have wrought destruction throughout our land. Despite their defeat, we must reestablish some kind of order among the remaining populations if we wish to pursue other endeavors."
 glh_caucasia_desc:0 "The Caucasus mountains have always been a natural border between steppe peoples and the Christian kingdoms to the south. No longer. We will make the perilous journey across the mountains to subjugate the Alans and Cumans so that we can clear the way towards consolidating the entire region."
 glh_crimea_desc:0 "The Crimean Khan's rebellious tendencies and the continued presence of the Gothic Principality of Theodoro have weakened our black sea presence. By reestablishing a hold over the Crimean peninsula and the surrounding steppe, we can project our power to distances only possible in the distant past."
 glh_reconciliation_desc:0 "Having long shaken off the Tatar yoke, the Ruthenian principalities are now divided and weak. Perhaps now, they will be more sympathetic to our interests, viewing us as a valuable potential ally rather than a threat."
 glh_integrate_ruthenians_desc:0 "The Ruthenians were largely autonomous during the first period in which we ruled over them. Now that we have reintegrated Ruthenia, we should invite them to participate more actively in our state, both politically and militarily. We have seen their cossack cavalry and are sure that they will make fine participants in our government and especially our army."
 glh_restore_kiev_desc:0 "Kiev has fallen into disrepair over the centuries. The once-great capital of Slavic culture has become a shadow of its former self. For the appeasement of the Ruthenians, we will spend the money to rebuild the city so that it may attain something approaching its previous glory."
 glh_rus_desc:0 "The remaining Slavs of eastern europe were some of the most resistant groups to the original Mongol conquest, some of them even managing to evade the Tatar yoke. These proud and independent princes will be subjugated before they even know our armies have crossed the Dnieper."
 glh_novgorod_desc:0 "The northernmost state of the Rus', Novgorod, was an afterthought to the Golden Horde hundreds of years ago - yet, with the other Russian princes subjugated, we see nothing else left in the region to conquer. We’ve been led to believe that White Sea trade is quite lucrative, and the city of Novgorod entices us with its potential for rich plunder indeed."
 glh_all_rus_desc:0 "With the last Rus' princes integrated into the state, it only follows that we should take the title that the Grand Prince of Kiev once held, and have [Root.Monarch.GetName] declare [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of all the Rus'."
 glh_finland_desc:0 "The Finns are low in population but rich in land area. Despite their native region having little economic value, its strategic utility should be taken into consideration. If we conquer Finland now, at least we won't have to do it in the dead of a harsh winter, with their fortifications properly prepared."
 glh_poland_desc:0 "Beyond our Ruthenian possessions lie the Poles. These religiously divided and fiercely independent tribes have continuously committed incursions at our border. The sons of Lech shall quickly learn that they are no match for the sons of Ghengis."
 glh_rome_desc:0 "The so-called Romans to our west are a meddlesome bunch of liars and scoundrels. What leg up do they have on us to carry such an air of superiority? Their power is shaky enough as it is. Perhaps it's time to teach them just how 'barbarous' we really are!"
 glh_sea_desc:0 "The Black Sea provides trading opportunities, but the merchants loyal to our state are threatened by the navies of Turks, Romans, and Bulgars alike. In order to protect their interests, we should construct a formidable fleet of our own."
 glh_yam_desc:0 "The road systems of our state were largely eroded or destroyed during our long period of decline. The ease of travel that our armies and envoys once enjoyed has become increasingly hard to come by. We should invest in our roads to reestablish the once-famous safety of travel across the former Mongol Empire."
 glh_state_desc:0 "Tartaria's young government has done relatively well for having been established so haphazardly, but our leader fears the possibility of rebellion in the future. By reforming and centralizing the government, we can establish a mutual trust between the crown and the provinces to ensure the stability of the realm."
 glh_baltic_desc:0 "The Baltic states have resisted Christian conversion and conquest in the past, but we are a new force altogether. More access to warm-water ports is always good, and the Baltic Sea has plenty of them."
 glh_sarai_desc:0 "Sarai has evolved over the centuries from a small encampment where the Golden Horde's Khan made his capital to a bustling metropolis. We will develop the city further, such that it may be mentioned in conversations alongside Cordoba, Khanbaliq, and Constantinople as being one of the world's greatest."
 glh_urbanize_desc:0 "The vast steppes that were once the geographic advantage of our ancestors now seem the perfect location for the construction of great cities. The open plains will be easy to transport building materials and migrants across so that we may easily raise our new urban centers."
 glh_asia_desc:0 "The many Mongol successor states of Central Asia are stuck in the past and chained to their traditions. They stand little chance against our advanced arms and the lands they hold will provide new frontiers for our people to settle."
 glh_tartaria_desc:0 "Having united the majority of the European and Central Asian regions of the former Mongol Empire, we have effectively brought together all the peoples of the steppe into a single, organized kingdom for the first time. Now, it is time to reach even further beyond, into the boundaries that only Ghengis Khan and his sons could reach."
 glh_motherland_desc:0 "Having conquered our way across Eurasia, we find ourselves face to face with the Great Yuan. Effectively our mother state, we cannot help but feel nostalgic when looking upon the open fields surrounding Karakorum. This land could be ours too, however, if we were to simply conquer it as well..."
 glh_ural_desc:0 "With the western Eurasian steppe consolidated, we find ourselves looking across the Ural mountains towards the remaining hordes that populate the eastern steppe. They're not exactly the most centralized of states, and their land is enticing to our settlers and armies. We will make war against our former brothers if it means advancing the needs of our people."

It seems over the past few centuries, it has been plagued with turmoil - Goths, Greeks, steppe peoples, Slavs and worst of all, Latins, have bickered over it. Let us step in and drink from the riches of the steppe."
 tur_black_sea_title:0 "Monopolize the Black Sea"

Truly a Turkish Delight!"

 tur_gates_desc:0 "Our Mediterranean domination is threatened by one last complication - the opening to the west. From the vast Atlantic, marauding Christians make their way to spell our doom - and worst of all, the incompetent Andalusians have been more than willing to let these infidels have their way.

Peasants toil away for three hours or less before tossing aside their tools and lazing about. Ungrateful nobles line their pockets with profits intended for our coffers. Goods find themselves regularly seized and repurposed by the muddy hands responsible for making them. We must correct this trend - in turn not only centralising production, but multiplying it tenfold, forever!"

Men quiver at the mere mention of their elite mercenary assassins - rumoured to boast dark magic, poison-tipped blades and the ability to rain comets upon foes.\n\nBogdanoff is the name.

 nrm_rebuild_fleet_desc:0 "Ever since the second invasion of England ended, our fleet has fallen into disfavor due to the need of an army to constantly quell rebellions. But now, we have secured control of our new lands, and there are plenty of rivals who want to carve up our conquest. Luckily, England is on an island, which allows us to build a wooden wall to prevent any invaders from landing. Rebuilding and upgrading the invasion fleet into a defensive fleet is now our new top priority to secure our domination over the British Isles." 
 nrm_feudal_army_title:0 "Feudal Army" 
 nrm_feudal_army_desc:0 "The English never had the glory of feudalism, which resulted in the lack of knights in their military. This major flaw in their army should have resulted in their defeat in the first invasion, but they got lucky with the death of William the Bastard. We need to expand our knights ever further to bolster feudalism across England and encourage chivalry among the elites."

 nrm_wool_title:0 "Expand the Wool Industry" 
 nrm_wool_desc:0 "The rural lands of England allow for the rural herding lifestyle to prosper, and no herd is prospering as much as sheep.

 nrm_industrial_title:0 "The Industrial Revolution" 
 nrm_industrial_desc:0 "Coal is quite an abundant resource in England, and some clever scholars have found a way to utilize coal to increase production.

 nrm_universities_desc:0 "The universities of Oxford and Cambridge were Anglo-Saxon creations to help promote the spread of knowledge among their elite. Luckily, many of the scholars teaching there were happy to promote Norman ways of thinking in their teachers for only a small bribe. By expanding the universities even further, we can establish England as a center of learning and understanding."

 nrm_dominate_caribbean_desc:0 "The Caribbean is an excellent region to farm goods such as sugar and cotton. Trade between ports has attracted pirates and privateers all across the world. The English do not have time for competition, we will kick them out and reap the profits for ourselves."

Fortunately, our explorers have found a land where we can send them, and such an inhospitable land will surely kill them. If they do somehow survive in such a place, then we have a new colony to tax as well."
 nrm_spice_trade_title:0 "Control the Spice Market" 
 nrm_spice_trade_desc:0 "Spice is the most valuable thing to an Anglois, as it not only adds flavor to our food, but it can also help us pass off rotten meat as fresh. The spice islands are unfortunately under the control of savages and rivals, but when has that ever stopped us before?"

 wls_po_valley_title: "Strike Into the Po Valley"
 wls_po_valley_desc: "In ancient times, Celts known as the Insubres inhabited the lush marshes of the Po Valley. It was said that the fabled city of Milan, the jewel of Lombardy, was founded by their earnest hands and proclaimed their capital. Just like our forefathers in Prydain, however, their reign did not last - for invaders, namely the Romans, ousted and spat upon them. Given our current track record - and a successful track record at that - of reclaiming lost, rightful Celtic land, the Po Valley is ripe for the taking."
 wls_rome_title: "Reclaim Rhufain"
 wls_rome_desc: "Insubria has been reclaimed. More work is left to do, however - namely, Central Italy. Our philosophers, historians, nobles and clergy have stood invariably united, or at least earnest, in regards to the idea of Celtic restoration - but in recent years, a new idea has become dominant, almost replacing the original Celtic dream. In a final act of vengeance against Europe, we now seek to claim the mantle of Rome itself - and make all of Italy a holding of the Celts, now and forever, starting with the ancient city of Rhufain and its adjacent provinces."
 wls_rhineland_title: "Secure the Rhineland"
 wls_rhineland_desc: "The Rhineland - the ancient divide between the Celtic and Germanic worlds - finds itself reduced to a babbling, tattered mess of foolish German lords and monks. The likes of the mighty Treveri of old would shudder to hear the German tongue uttered so boldly on the banks of the Rhine! In the name of their lost honour and culture, we shall reclaim the Rhineland, restoring the ancient border of the Celtic world."
 wls_germany_title: "Push Into Yr Almaen"
 wls_germany_desc: "Roman and Greek scholars alike theorised that our ancient heartland lays in the lands of Yr Almaen - the idyllic pastures, hills and mountains north of the Alps. Thousands of years ago, our brave forefathers struck out from the region, settling Gaul, Prydain and more. Let us return to this lost homeland, restore Celtic dominance and drive back our eternal Germanic rivals."
 wls_hre_title: "Destroy the False Empire"
 wls_hre_desc: "Rome itself was a false and unworthy empire, having succeeded through sly cunning, trickery, dishonourable diplomacy and fiendish lies. Something far worse has taken its place however, limited mainly to the lands east of the Rhine. Despite its claims to the contrary,  it is clearly not quite Holy, not quite Roman and not quite an Empire. Some say it would be best to let this pitiful beast continue to fumble and stumble, standing as an example of German ineptitude, but the decentralised empire's unpredictable  tendency towards coalitions and sporadic bursts of unity make it a danger to Prydain. Let us shatter its spirit forever."
 wls_union_ireland_title: "Union With the Irish"
 wls_union_ireland_desc: "With a foothold in Ireland established, it is appropriate that we integrate the island fully. Our lords stand eager to carve up the remaining Irish property and have already invested a great deal in their private security forces, bolstered fortifications and local integration efforts. Should we aid them, Ireland could prove to be a new arm of Prydain proper and offer a deep pool of manpower."
 wls_ostmark_title: "Take Carnuntum"
 wls_ostmark_desc: "Carnuntum, an eastern extension of the Celtic heartland, would serve as a valuable frontier. Its harsh mountains, winding rivers and geopolitical importance would provide our army now and forever a springboard with which to sharpen our infantry's readiness and hardiness against the grinding barbarians of the east."
 wls_moors_title: "Defeat the Moors"
 wls_moors_desc: "Iberia, once a heartland of the Celtic world, has been ravaged by war. Not only have countless conflicts reduced its once-fertile valleys and grasslands to arid, hellish wastes, but so have the former Celtic populations been brushed aside. If we were to strike a blow to the peninsula's dominant Muslim power and secure a foothold in the northern mountains, we could not only embolden our forces and announce a Celtic return to Iberia, but also signal to all of Europe an end to the leering Muslim hegemony."
 wls_conversion_title: "Complete the Conversion"
 wls_conversion_desc: "The brutal battle of Valencia stands avenged. Christians all over Europe marvel at our achievement. Now, with the peninsula secured, sheltered beneath the wing of the Lord once more, the true faith may be restored to the valleys of Iberia. For it is written - 'He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.'"
 wls_sitaly_title: "Liberate South Italy"
 wls_sitaly_desc: "A horror has befallen Italy's south. Much like Iberia, it has been claimed by Muslim ravagers, whom have entrenched the narrow peninsula with their ways and faith. Two can play at that game. The Celtic world is always in need of new holdings; if the foul sultanate were to fall to our might, the oppressed and tarnished inhabitants would flock to our banners and the true faith, eager to be accepted."

 ab_eng_wales_desc:0 "The March of Wales was established by the Godwin dynasty to slowly integrate the Welsh into our growing kingdom, but a peasant rebellion broke out in Wales after the death of Edgar the Atheling in 1126 AD. Afterwards, the Cyning’s army suffered a devastating defeat at the battle of Harlech, which resulted in the entire march breaking away. It is time to rectify these wrongs and reestablish the Welsh March once again."
 ab_eng_cornwall_title:0 "Reclaim Cornwall" 
 ab_eng_cornwall_desc:0 "During the first English anarchy in 1126, the Cornish Duke rebelled and occupied Devon. The constant turmoil and infighting between Heptarchs has distracted our previous rulers from restoring order in the south, but it is time to remedy this. We will reconquer our lands and make the Cornish pay for their treachery."
 ab_eng_fyrd_title:0 "Cyning's Fyrd" 
 ab_eng_fyrd_desc:0 "The English army hasn’t always been the most unified force. Local levies from the Heptarchs and various nobles make up the majority of our armed forces. To further distance ourselves from relying on levies from questionably loyal vassals, we will establish the Royal Army. A loyal and effective fighting force that answers to the Cyning and Cyning only. This will not only strengthen our position on the isles, but also weaken malicious forces inside the realm as well."
 ab_eng_hull_title:0 "End the Danelaw" 
 ab_eng_hull_desc:0 "The heathen Danes have occupied Hull since the Heptarch Wars, and while a united front was formed to repel the invaders, the advance has stagnated into a stalemate between the Danish raiders and our loyal English soldiers. To ensure our domination of the isles, we must reclaim Hull and kick the Danes out of England proper for good."
 ab_eng_haestingas_title:0 "Remember Haestingas" 
 ab_eng_haestingas_desc:0 "While we may have defeated the Normans and killed their bastard Duke William back in the battle of Haestingas, they still lay claim to our throne to this day. The King of Francia has attempted to enforce their claim before, and if we are not careful, they might attempt to do so again. We will conquer the Duchy of Normandy and avenge those who lost their life in Haestingas - nevermore will the English have to worry about a Norman Yoke."

 ab_eng_albion_desc:0 "After many years of conquest, bloodshed, and scheming, we have finally united the British Isles under one banner.

Together our United Kingdom shall rule the waves and dominate the world!"
 ab_eng_scotland_title:0 "Cross Hadrian's Wall" 
 ab_eng_scotland_desc:0 "Hadrian’s Wall was constructed by Roman Emperor Hadrian back in 122 AD to keep the northern Picts out of Roman England. Ever since the northern marches fell to the King of Scots during the anarchy of 1126, Hadrian’s Wall has been used to keep the Scots from encroaching further into English Lands. It is time to reconquer the northern march and establish a buffer between us and the Scots."
 ab_eng_ireland_title:0 "Laudable Conquest"

 ab_eng_north_sea_title:0 "Rule the North Sea" 
 ab_eng_north_sea_desc:0 "The North Sea has always been ruled by the Viking invaders. They cross from Scandinavia and dominate nearly every aspect of the north coast. It is time to turn the tables on the Vikings and overthrow their monopoly in the North Sea. No longer will every coastal village in England have to fear a possible Viking raid; now, the Vikings will fear us."
 ab_eng_danish_title:0 "Rival the Danish Navy" 
 ab_eng_danish_desc:0 "The only true external threat to the British Isles is the Viking raiders across the North Sea. For over 50 years, we have fought a slow and brutal battle to reclaim York from the Danes. To ensure that they can not raid our coast or reinforce their armies, it is necessary for us to construct the mightiest fleet the North Sea has ever seen."
 ab_eng_jutland_title:0 "Landfall in Scandinavia" 
 ab_eng_jutland_desc:0 "The next logical step towards fighting off the Viking raiders is to take the fight to their homeland. By landing and occupying Jutland, we will cripple any Danish attempt to reinvade the British Isles. First Jutland, then Scandinavia!"
 ab_eng_stamford_title:0 "Legacy of Stamfordbrycge" 
 ab_eng_stamford_desc:0 "Hundreds of years ago, our legendary Cyning defeated the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada at the battle of Stamfordbrycge. The complete rout of the Norwegian army should have been the end of the Viking age, but infighting between Heptarchs and the Cyning has allowed the Vikings to once again pillage the coast. Today, however, we have landed and struck a fatal blow against the Norwegians by occupying the ancient home of Harald Hardrada. This resounding success will shatter the resolve of the heathen armies."
 ab_eng_sound_toll_title:0 "Control the Sound Toll" 
 ab_eng_sound_toll_desc:0 "The Sound Toll sits as one of the most profitable institutions in the Baltic Sea. The ability to toll any merchant ship that passes through would be extremely beneficial to our economy. Let us occupy the Danish Heartlands of København and take over this institution. With complete control of the Sound Toll, we will be able to push further into the Baltic sea and destroy the Norse menace."
 ab_eng_hansa_title:0 "Hanseatic Heartland" 
 ab_eng_hansa_desc:0 "The Hanseatic League is one of the richest trade leagues in all of Europe. With ports all across Europe belonging to it. From London to Neva, From Aachen to Danzig, the size and power of this league is impressive. Seizing the center of the league and taking over their trade routes would ensure English trade domination of not just the Baltic, but all of Europe."
 ab_eng_pagan_title:0 "Dismantle the Pagan Realms" 
 ab_eng_pagan_desc:0 "After so long, we have finally avenged all those who have lost their lives to the Viking raids. Ever since the first raid in 793 AD, the Isles have known nothing but fear and turmoil, but now we have fully conquered all the Norse lands, and with this victory, we will never let another Viking desecrate our shores. God Save England!"
 ab_eng_highlands_title:0 "Storm the Highlands" 
 ab_eng_highlands_desc:0 "The Highlands of Scotland are home to the most resilient clans on the whole Island. They have resisted every effort from foreign invaders to conquer their lands. Subjugating them will not be an easy task, but doing so would be a groundbreaking achievement and truly establish England as the foremost power on the Isles."
 ab_eng_acts_title:0 "The Acts of Union" 
 ab_eng_acts_desc:0 "The Crown of Scotland has always been a thorn in our side, from constant fighting and underhanded dealings with rebellious Heptarchs, they have made it their goal to weaken English authority on the Isles, but perhaps we can come to terms with the Scots. By formally uniting the Crown of England with the Crown of Scotland, we can create a sense of Unity between English and Scots, and maybe they will learn to accept and love us. We can only hope."
 ab_eng_isles_title:0 "Liberate the Isles" 
 ab_eng_isles_desc:0 "The Norwegian raiders have unjustly occupied various Isles around Britain for over a century. Viking raids are frequently conducted from these isles and many hostages are held on and extorted from them. By conquering these Isles back from the Norwegians, we can secure a safer coast for all of Britain, but more importantly England."
 ab_eng_fate_title:0 "Fate of the Irish" 
 ab_eng_fate_desc:0 "The Irish don’t seem too keen on being subjects of the Cynnig. Constant rebellions, refusal to pay taxes, and a disregard for English law has become quite common on the Emerald Isle. While we could always do it the old fashioned way and force the Irish to respect the law, we could also grant them some autonomy, allowing them to keep local laws in place and pay limited taxes. Either way, we will have to deal with them before the whole Isle revolts."
 ab_eng_dutch_title:0 "Rival the Dutch" 
 ab_eng_dutch_desc:0 "The Dutch remain the only real threat to English control in the channel. By investing more into the Channel, we can overtake the Dutch completely, allowing us to drain their coffers dry through trade, opening them up to a naval invasion."
 ab_eng_holland_title:0 "Invade Holland" 
 ab_eng_holland_desc:0 "The area around Holland contains some of the most prosperous and populous cities in all of Europe.

 ab_eng_lowlands_desc:0 "The lowlands are highly coveted lands by all their neighbors. From the Lotharingians to Franks to upstart Germans, everyone wants a piece. It is only natural for us to want the Lowlands as well. By conquering the Lowlands, we can also unite the staple port of Calais with our newly conquered lands."
 ab_eng_channel_title:0 "Dominate the Channel" 
 ab_eng_channel_desc:0 "The English channel is slowly becoming the most important trade center in the world. With trade flowing from the Baltic, France, Germany, and the new world, there is a major incentive to ensure complete English domination of the channel. Complete dominance of the channel will help expand our empire to hegemonic status across the globe."
 ab_eng_german_title:0 "German Alliances"

 ab_eng_reinforce_title:0 "Reinforce the Coastline" 
 ab_eng_reinforce_desc:0 "The biggest threat to England does not come from the Isles, but rather across the North Sea or English Channel.

 ab_eng_admiralty_title:0 "The British Admiralty" 
 ab_eng_admiralty_desc:0 "Generals in history have always received more credit than admirals. Everyone remembers the likes of Caesar and Hannibal, but no one seems to remember Lucullus and his key victories against the Carthaginians. However in Britain, we respect our admirals more than any other nation. They are the first line of defense for our nation, and as such, they need proper training to ensure our continued naval supremacy. The finest admirals in all of the world will come from our new admiralties."

 ab_eng_absolutism_title:0 "English Absolutism" 
 ab_eng_absolutism_desc:0 "Years of internal conflict in England has only weakened the Kingdom. The Heptarch wars show that the devolution of powers is a foolish idea.

 ab_eng_burh_title:0 "Fortify the Burhs" 
 ab_eng_burh_desc:0 "In retrospect, the one downside of rejecting fedualism is the lack of castles and other fortifications to defend our Burhs. Sure the peasants are freer, but history has shown that vikings can raid our shores much easier than the heavily fortified shores of Francia. Local fortifications and trenches should deter any major force from attacking us." 
 ab_eng_regulate_title:0 "Regulate the Fyrd" 
 ab_eng_regulate_desc:0 "The Fyrd is a rather outdated system from the middle ages. The levy raised by the kings just does not match up to the standing armies of modern warfare.

We also need to find some crazy enough explorer to go chart out some of the forest for us, if they make it back alive."

 ab_eng_brazilwood_desc:0 "When we first landed in the Amazon, we were shocked by the biodiversity of the region, but we were more shocked by the luxurious wood that is growing everywhere. We can not let any other power have access to these trees, only English markets will be selling luxury furniture made from this coveted wood." 
 ab_eng_guinea_title:0 "West African Bases" 
 ab_eng_guinea_desc:0 "There is a bit more to Africa than we initially anticipated, and obviously the next choice is to further explore and colonize the region. The local natives seem weary of our intentions, but they will soon understand it is better to be English than Frankish or Andalusian."

 ab_eng_slave_trade_desc:0 "It is hard to farm cash crops, you know? Back-breaking labor, heatstroke, and very unfavorable conditions just make it seem not worth it to farmers. We have a solution, and while weak-knee liberals and some members of the church might protests, there is plenty of slaves to be had in Africa. Surely no one would look back on this poorly right?" 
 ab_eng_cape_town_title:0 "Found the Cape Colony" 
 ab_eng_cape_town_desc:0 "Our continued conquest of the world has run into a slight issue. Africa is quite large and difficult to get around. Our merchants and explorers need rest stops along the way. There is a marvelous spot to establish one of these outposts near the Cape of Good Hope, we just have to beat the other powers there." 
 ab_eng_scramble_title:0 "Scramble for Africa" 
 ab_eng_scramble_desc:0 "Africa was once viewed as merely outposts and slavers to us, but now we see that there are many riches to be had inside the dark continent. The other great powers have gotten word of this too, and now we are all scrambling to carve out as much land as we can. The race for Africa has begun, and we shall not lose!"

 ab_eng_into_beyond_desc:0 "The world is larger than most think, and some of our more daring explorers have proposed that the riches of Asia are not that far away to the west.

 ab_eng_aztec_gold_desc:0 "Reports of cities of gold have come from our explorers in Mesoamerica, and the Aztec empire seems to be the source of this gold. Conquering the Aztecs will please other local tribes and also grant us access to more gold for our empire."

 ab_eng_feorland_desc:0 "There is no place like home, and we discovered a large swathe of land that is very similar to our native England.

 ab_eng_native_relations_title:0 "Trade with the Natives" 
 ab_eng_native_relations_desc:0 "So there was not as much riches in Feorland in the way of gold, but the natives hold secrets on crops that could be sold for much more than basic wheat. Corn, Tobacco, Indigo, all of these can be bought from the natives. Fortunately, the natives are not as militarized as the Aztecs so they will not be as upset that we are buying their land." 
 ab_eng_plains_title:0 "Settle the Great Plains" 
 ab_eng_plains_desc:0 "Our explorers tell us of flat rolling plains that are perfect for growing wheat, corn, and potatoes. It is a perfect spot for us to establish farmlands to actually feed our colonists. This influx of food will allow our colonists in Feorland to grow more cash crops instead of food." 
 ab_eng_empire_title:0 "Transatlantic Empire" 
 ab_eng_empire_desc:0 "It has been done, the Atlantic has become nothing more than our backyard. Around the clock shipping and naval patrols between our colonies and England has made piracy and privateering a thing of the past. Goods and immigrants flood back and forth, spreading wealth and good English values wherever they go. The world shall remember the English empire and its colonies will forever control the Atlantic, God Save the Cyning!"

With the land in our hands, we have given it the far more fitting title of 'Belgae' - but a name is not enough. The Brittonic tongue must flourish within the city's walls, businesses must thrive and the ports must bustle anew - for our kingdom deserves a better capital than a measly little rural cove."
 crn_revival_title:0 "Economic Revival"
 crn_revival_desc:0 "It is no secret that our realm has always been somewhat humble, known for only a handful of resources and industries, albeit rich and well-known. Our tin mines, for instance, have been a staple of our identity for as long as we can remember - some historians claiming that the riches of our mines found themselves as far-flung as the Levant, among the Phoenicians of old.

While we were busy attempting to court the newly independent Norse-Gael city states of Dublin, Cork, and Waterford, the Ua Nialls refused our summons to court, and stopped paying their taxes to the High King. Murchadh Ua Conchobair had a tough decision; fighting the Ua Naill would have most likely ended in a pyrrhic victory at best, with their defensible terrain favoring the northern clans. So, Murcadh allowed the clan to go free, and instead work on fostering inter-clan relations. However, this disintegrated trust within the local clans of Ireland, who saw that so long as they had some modicum of power, the Conchobairs wouldn’t be able to stop them from seizing the throne of Ireland. We must establish the authority and power of the High King across Ireland if we are to ever rule this land effectively, bringing back the prosperity we saw before the Anglo Invasions."

 ire_fate_title:0 "Fate of the High King"
 ire_fate_desc:0 "In the year 1412, the Crisis of the Ua Naill began. While we were busy attempting to court the newly independent Norse-Gael city states of Dublin, Cork, and Waterford, the Ua Nialls refused our summons to court, and stopped paying their taxes to the High King. Murchadh Ua Conchobair had a tough decision; fighting the Ua Naill would have most likely ended in a pyrrhic victory at best, with their defensible terrain favoring the northern clans. So, Murcadh allowed the clan to go free, and instead work on fostering inter-clan relations. However, this disintegrated trust within the local clans of Ireland, who saw that so long as they had some modicum of power, the Conchobairs wouldn’t be able to stop them from seizing the throne of Ireland. We must establish the authority and power of the High King across Ireland if we are to ever rule this land effectively, bringing back the prosperity we saw before the Anglo Invasions."

Private enterprises, promising the crown even greater profits, have begun to spring up within our great port cities and industrial towns. They talk of markets and costs and monopolies and companies, and while our High King admittedly has no idea what they are talking about, their numbers do not lie. If we are to embrace this new market revolution, it can make us rich beyond our wildest dreams!"

 south_africa_colony_SCO_desc:0 "The southern tip of Africa has become the most important cape for all of Europe. All overseas trade from India passes through it, and our conquest of the cape will ensure that we get a portion of that trade for ourselves.

 lit_seize_danzig_desc:0 "The last remaining crusader state in the Baltic is the Republic of Danzig, who claim the entirety of Pruthenia as theirs. This once proud Romuva city is now a city of decadence ruled by the Barbarous Germans, loyal only to money and nothing else. The light of the Romuva faith must be restored to Gdanskas and the Germans evicted." 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_title:0 "Defeat Pruthenia" 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_desc:0 "Pruthenia to our west is the only other real Romuva power in the Baltic. Sadly, their failure to reconquer Gdanskas from the German crusaders proves they are too incompetent to remain independent. To prevent any further success from the crusaders, Pruthenia must be taught a lesson." 
 lit_future_title:0 "The Future of our Nation" 
 lit_future_desc:0 "The Baltics are united, our foes have been defeated and the Grand Dukes central authority has been asserted. Now the question remains of what will Lithuania become? Lithuania could stick to her roots, uniting all the Pagans together under one flag to resist the onslaught of Christians from east and west. Lithuania could pursue a closer relationship with the Orthodox Rus to the east, and work together to defeat the Mongol threat. Or perhaps Lithuania could accept the ways of the Crusaders, and fulfil the goal of the Baltic Crusades and destroy Paganism in Europe." 
 lit_unite_baltic_title:0 "Unite the Baltics" 
 lit_unite_baltic_desc:0 "The last remaining roadblock in our way towards Baltic domination is the Suomenusko Duchy of Estonia.

 lit_konigsberg_title:0 "Found Karaliaucius"

Karaliaucius will become the city of cities in the Baltic." 
 lit_forest_title:0 "Clear the Forested Areas"

 lit_marshes_title:0 "Tame the Marshes" 
 lit_marshes_desc:0 "Another major issue with Lithuania is the sheer amount of marshes that spread across our land. The terrain is unfavourable for humans and clearing marsh is not cheap in any way. But we must persevere to ensure that our people can expand and prosper. The Marshes of Lithuania will bow to our industrial might and make way for new cities across the land." 
 lit_countryside_title:0 "Develop the Countryside" 
 lit_countryside_desc:0 "As much as we would hate to admit it, Lithuania is a poor realm compared to those of the west and east.

The first step is to expand the farming countryside so there will be food to support growing Lithuanian cities."

 lit_seat_desc:0 "Every great empire has a famous capital. Rome and Constantinople for the Romans, Babylon for Alexander, Aachen for the Franks, yet Lithuania has no grand capital to call her own.

 lit_pirates_title:0 "Deal with the Pirates" 
 lit_pirates_desc:0 "The pirates in Gotland constantly raid the entirety of the Baltic. If we truly are the masters of the Baltic, then they must go, once and for all. Gotland will bend the knee to Lithuania, and we are sure a few pirates would gladly serve us and raid our rivals."

 lit_ports_title:0 "Baltic Trade Ports" 
 lit_ports_desc:0 "Just owning a merchant fleet does not mean we will gain all the benefits of trade. Foreign merchants still need somewhere to stop and trade if we want to profit from them.

 lit_merchant_desc:0 "Trade is necessary for any emerging state to thrive. Without it, we might not have the wealth to expand into our neighbours.

If not, we might not ever reach our full potential."
