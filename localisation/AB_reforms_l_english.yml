 #Bohemia
 wenceslas:0 "Crown of St. Wenceslas"
 wenceslas_desc:0 "The estates of Bohemia hold immense power and are the ones who elect the future Bohemian king. Even though the dynasties of Premyslids and Luxembourgs made the election seem hereditary, it was mostly done by granting various privileges to the estates or buying enough votes. We must be cautious and do not enrage the estates if we wish to keep our dynasty on the throne."
 bohmining:0 "Reform Bergordnung"
 bohmining_desc:0 "The mining laws and regulations should be reviewed and if needed, reformed and modernized. If we manage to create a good environment for the miners, all of Bohemia will prosper!"
 bohgunner:0 "Bohemian Handgunners"
 bohgunner_desc:0 "The followers of Hus revolutionized the use of firearms during the Hussite Wars. Despite being ultimately defeated, they proved that handguns are an extremely useful and powerful tool in the battle. It would be foolish not to use it."
 bohelection:0 "Support of the Nobles"
 bohelection_desc:0 "The election of a king in Bohemia is largely controlled by the estates of our lands. If we wish to retain the throne for our dynasty, we must ensure that the estates are always backing our candidate."
 bohsnem:0 "Zemsky Snem"
 bohsnem_desc:0 "The growth of our realm requires an establishment of a new constitutional body. The new Bohemian Diet will ensure that the lords and peasants of the lands of the Bohemian crown have an extensive share in the political sphere."
 #Francia
 frankish_crown:0 "Frankish Monarchy"
 frankish_crown_desc:0 "Even though Feudalism had not caused the Western Frankish Kingdom to fragment as much as the Eastern Empire had, the bonds of vassalage and granting of fiefs still plays an important role in Frankish society. A ruler has to have the support of the feudal lords and the most powerful of them are there to keep his power in check."
 fraexpand:0 "Expand Noble Privileges"
 fraexpand_desc:0 "In order to ensure that our feudal subjects stay loyal, we should expand their privileges and guarantee their rights. We can't afford to create distrust between the nobles and the crown."
 fracurtail:0 "Curtail Noble Privileges"
 fracurtail_desc:0 "The nobles of Francia have enjoyed far too much freedom. The future of Francia lies in centralization, and due to that, we must strengthen the position of the crown, even if its at the expense of the nobility."
 frapalatium:0 "Palatium"
 frapalatium_desc:0 "Historically, the Frankish Emperors relied on Palatium, a shifting assemblage of family members, trusted lay and ecclesiastical companions, and assorted hangers-on, which constituted an itinerant court following the king as he carried out his military campaigns and sought to take advantage of the income from widely scattered royal estates. Members of this circle, some with titles suggesting primitive administrative departments, performed on royal orders various functions related to managing royal resources, conducting military campaigns and diplomatic missions, producing written documents required to administer the realm, undertaking missions across the kingdom to enforce royal policies, rendering justice, conducting religious services, and counseling the king."
 fracavalry:0 "Frankish Knights"
 fracavalry_desc:0 "The strong cavalry traditions of our armies date back to the times of Charles Martel. Even the mighty Emperor Charlemagne used large numbers of cavalry during his campaigns of conquest. We must further strengthen the position of cavalry in our armed forces and equip them with the newest weaponry so that they may wreak havoc on the battlefield."
 frcoriflamme:0 "Institute the Porte-Oriflamme"
 frcoriflamme_desc:0 "The practice of using standards in warfare dates all the way back to the time of the Romans, with regiments rallying behind their standard and generals using this to organize armies more efficiently. Recently, however, each Duke and Noble in the Kingdom has their own system of standards, making it difficult for us to organize a cohesive army. Instead, let us create a uniform standard system for our regiments, allowing for cohesion and unity between ranks."
 frcfeudalism:0 "Strengthen Frankish Feudalism"
 frcfeudalism_desc:0 "The Frankish realm has always relied on the loyalty of Dukes and Nobles to keep the state together. We should further expand this and grant more autonomy to our vassals. This allows us to not have to directly handle the burden of managing their land and ensures that the nobles stay loyal. Of course this weakens the central authority of the King, but earning the loyalty of our vassals is worth it."
 mechanic_unlocks_strong_duchies_privilege_yes:0 "Unlocks the §YStrong Duchies§! privilege."
 frcgendarmerie:0 "Establish the Gendarmerie"
 frcgendarmerie_desc:0 "The ancient role of the Gendarmerie as men-at-arms and heavily armored knights is becoming increasingly obsolete when faced against modern weapons and techniques. Instead, we should reforge this role as a military police force tasked with ensuring local stability in Frankish lands. Gendarmerie will receive basic military training and equipment to help keep any revolts down while also serving as a reserve force for our military."
 frcassembly:0 "Imperial Assembly"
 frcassembly_desc:0 "The Imperial Assemblies and Diets have constantly changed purpose and organization over the past few centuries. Originally serving as an advisory and law-making body for Charlemagne, the Assembly slowly but surely weakened the power of the Emperor over time in favor of the Princes. It is now time for us to reform this system into something that fits our interest more. This new Imperial Assembly will serve as a confirmation of Frankish supremacy across the Empire, and allow us to return powers delegated to the Princes."
 mechanic_gain_dip_on_emperor_reelection_yes:0 "Grants §G100§! £dip£ upon each successive Imperial re-election."
 frcstate:0 "State Catholicism"
 frcstate_desc:0 "The Catholic Church and the Franks have always had a deep history together. Starting with the Baptism of Clovis and the conversion of the Franks, to the coronation of Charlemagne, to the Crusades in the Levant and Iberia, The King and the Church have always had a special relationship. It is time we further solidify this relationship into law, making Catholicism our official state religion and persecuting heretics and heathens alike. Grand Dieu Sauve le Roi!"
 frcrepresentatives:0 "Representatives of the Empire"
 frcrepresentatives_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire is a diverse and complicated mess of Princes, clergymen, and a growing burgher class. If we are to effectively rule over such a mess, it must be organized to prevent conflicts and bloodshed between these estates. We will create a department entirely dedicated to handling the disputes between Princes to keep the Empire together."
 frcrenaissance:0 "Second Carolingian Renaissance"
 frcrenaissance_desc:0 "Before the reign of Charlemagne, Europe was going through a dark age in its history. Literacy, law, order, arts, and culture had all disappeared with the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It was not until the rule of Charlemagne and his descendants that these ideas would return and flourish in the Frankish Empire. The Renaissance in Italy is not unlike the Caroligian one that took place centuries earlier, and we should strive to fund the arts and sciences to create a new Carolingian Renaissance centered around Francia."

 norsanction_desc:0 "The Christian kingdom of Sweden threatens our very way of life with its proximity. The Norwegian people must not be made to forget the Aesir!"
 northralls_desc:0 "Thralls, the lowest class in our society, have long been exploited and abused by the nobility. Despite their diminutive status, we must establish legal protections for them to assure their loyalty."
 norvarangian_desc:0 "The Varangians, elite Viking mercenaries tasked with protecting the Emperor of the Romans, often return to Norway after their tenure in his stead. These invaluable veterans can be re-employed in service of the king of their own nation."
 norjvikings_desc:0 "The Saga of the Jomsvikings tells the story of a band of nigh-invincible norse mercenaries who lent their services to great kings both foreign and domestic. True students of history understand this Saga to be more than a story, but instead a record of historical fact! The restoration of the Jomsviking order will provide a prestigious upper echelon for our soldiers to strive towards, and those members of it will be the finest warriors in the land."
 mechanic_unlocks_jomsvikings_yes:0 "Unlocks the §YJomsvikings§! mercenary company"
 noralthing_desc:0 "The Althing was a kind of parliament established by Icelandic residents many years ago. This representative body was an outlet for the common people to voice their concerns and ideas regarding the nation's governance.

 #Hisn Kayfa reforms
 hsnscholars:0 "Invite Western Scholars"
 hsnscholars_desc:0 "The western scholars of Europe follow a religion that disgraces the word of Allah which is very unfortunate, and to most it would be enough of a reason to keep them as far from their lands as humanly possible, thankfully we are much more wise than that. They may spew heresy but among those words are those of wisdom, ever since the Mongols sacked the Middle East, the Islamic Golden age has ended, and Christian Europe has been slowly but surely surpassing us in terms of engineering, medicine and math, in times like these we should seek the wisdom of these people."
 hsnatabegs:0 "Assign Atabegs"
 hsnatabegs_desc:0 "When the Seljuks rolled through the region they needed a way to govern those they conquered, Atabegs were their answer, nobles of Turkic blood that would govern an entire region, by Seljuk law they would even start their own dynasties in those regions which connected their family's destiny to regions of governance, this reduced any ambition which might have hurt the ruler otherwise. By employing a similar system in our conquered territories our administrative pressure would decrease significantly."
 hsnwaqf:0 "Waqf Donations"
 hsnwaqf_desc:0 "Waqf is a donation of money or property for religious reasons, as the Abbasids we are the true representatives of the Sword of Islam and thus have the right to encourage and exploit these donations in our favor, let's do just that!"
 hsntolerate:0 "Tolerate Religious Minorities"
 hsntolerate_desc:0 "Anatolia is not Arabia, unlike Arabia this place is not almost solely dominated by the servants of Allah, instead the region is packed to the brim with Orthodox Christians, Coptic Christians, Zoroastrians and many even smaller regional beliefs, instead of slamming our head against a wall by trying to convert each and every religious minority, destabilizing our country in the process, we should instead encourage those communities to preach whatever they want without state oppression."
 hsnmadrasa:0 "Madrasa and Madhab Schools"
 hsnmadrasa_desc:0 "Both Madrasa and Madhab schools have very similar purposes, to not only teach the children of Allah how to be better believers by making them learn the Quaran and Islamic law, but also educating them in science and in the Arabic language, we should focus our finances and efforts into the construction and expansion of such schools across our nation so that our citizens are the smartest they could be." 
 #Hansa
 hansahansetag:0 "Hansetag"
 hansahansetag_desc:0 "The Hansetag is a parlament esque body of representatives, each representing one of the many cities of the Hanseatic League, the Hansetag is called each time an issue encompasses multiple League cities, during the meeting the issue is addressed and hopefully resolved. \n \n The Hansetag has served us wonderfully so far, promoting unity within the league while also guaranteeing autonomy and rights to every city, if we want our league to prosper we should encourage and expand the Hansetag."
 hansacentralize:0 "Centralize the League"
 hansacentralize_desc:0 "As new cities become integrated into the League a massive problem arises, the massive decentralization makes it impossible to effectively govern them all, we simply cannot cater to every need and whim of every single city withouth creating problems for other cities or without exhausting our bureaucracy, a new controversial approach is needed. \n \n If we centralize our grip over the many autonomous cities we can resolve the many issues they face with much more independence and without the fear of upsetting some stuck up merchant family in another city 300km away. \n \n This will be a very controversial move that will no doubt inspire many protests from the autonomous cities, some even argue that centralizing our rule might kill the soul and purpose of the League, but with this reform we can focus on much more important matters then petty squables between cities while also guaranteeing their true rights and autonomy."
 hansaleifland:0 "Expand the Leifland Company"
 hansaleifland_desc:0 "The New World has so much untapped economic potential it is almost unbelievable that so little of it is utilized, sugar, coffee, some of the most fertile land in the world, tobbacco, corn, so many new fruits and mountains upon mountains of gold, it seems as If the continent not so long ago discovered is a land of milk and honey, but most importantly profit. \n \n The vast pools of resources sitting on this empty land almost beg to be used. \n \n So far the Leifland Company has asisted us in the colonization of these rich lands, the brains of the company allowed us to tap into these riches, making the ports of North Germany an entry for all these goods to the rest of central europe, but if we want to truly exploit all that God has laid down for us just one ocean away, we will need to massively expand the company's operation."
 hansacolonial:0 "Colonial Governors"
 hansacolonial_desc:0 "Our power lies in the New World where rich colonies produce massive amounts of money, the colonies indeed became so massive and rich that their issues outgrew the issues of League Cities in their importance, maybe the League at first was to cater to German city states in the north, but as of right now the League mainly exists to transport new world goods to the German cities, from which they spread across the rest of europe, it is time to acknowledge reality and stop clinging upon our old ideals, the League should be redesigned in a way that gives colonial governors true control over it, so that the whims of little cities in Germany no longer holds the League back."
 #Armenia
 armazatavrear:0 "Azatavrear Cavalry"
 armazatavrear_desc:0 "Our cavalry has been the envy of our neighbours for thousands of years. Not only has Armenia historically boasted a rich supply of horses, but also a martial aptitude and tradition for them. Even in peacetime, our Ayrudzi- collected from a myriad of classes throughout our long history, from the most humble of peasants to the most courageous of noble sons- found great experience and use in patrolling our precarious borders and guarding our king. Let us empower and encourage this persevering tradition."
 armnakharar:0 "Confirm the Nakharar Order"
 armnakharar_desc:0 "Nakharars, as they are known, are our nobles. Before even Christ's word graced our lands, Armenia consisted of tightly-knit, insular noble houses, hesitant to branch outwards into greater Caucasia and the Levant, preferring internal marriages and practicing steadfast endogamy. If we were to retain this practice and enrich our Nakharars with military expertise and experience, our nobility could become an ardently loyal military behemoth for centuries to come."
 armcrusader:0 "Crusader Nobility"
 armcrusader_desc:0 "Owing to our precarious position, it seems only appropriate that our nobility primarily consist of those with both will and aptitude for carrying out the Lord's will. While our wise and weathered clergy is demonstrative of the might of the divine pen, the zealous sword must not be neglected- and enriching our nobility with both prospective and veteran crusaders alike is an excellent start to this endeavour." 
 armfleet:0 "Expand the Merchant Fleet"
 armfleet_desc:0 "Provided we retain our miraculous gateway to the Mediterranean and pursue further openings to the seas, our merchants could more than double their current efficiency and establish a firm Armenian presence in the world of trade. Investing preferential treatment towards the construction and protection of our merchant fleet could expand their capacity significantly and thus enrich our coffers significantly."
 armchurch:0 "Reinforce the Apostolic Church"
 armchurch_desc:0 "Throughout our long and tired history, the Apostolic Church has found itself not only beaten down by marauding heathens, but also our own fellow brothers in faith, deeming our methodology and beliefs heretical. No more should we doubt ourselves, see us as half-hearted faithful- should we empower our church, giving it paramount preference within our holdings, we would draw in conversions at a far greater rate."
 armgreaterarmenia:0 "Resettle Greater Armenia"
 armgreaterarmenia_desc:0 "Over the years, Armenians across Caucasia and Anatolia alike have faced discrimination, assimilation and removal outright from our ancestral homelands and hard-earned frontiers. If we were to focus our efforts on resettlement and reclamation, the number of bold hearts among our tried and true Armenian population would grow, fostering a spirit and culture of colonisation and resettlement."

 byztheme_desc:0 "The Theme system is the organizational structure of the Roman Empire, in which the realm is divided into provinces called "Themes", each led by a Strategos, a military and political official who is tasked with adjudicating disputes, managing the theme's economy, and most importantly, conscripting troops into the Imperial Army."
 byzhellenization_desc: "The lands of Egypt and the Levant have fallen to the cultural and religious influence of arab-muslim powers since their conquest centuries ago. With these lands coming back into the fold, it follows that we should re-settle the cities of this region with Greeks."
 byztagmata_desc:0 "The Tagmata armies are the personal troops of the Emperor. These elite troops are conscripted from around the empire and often fight alongside foreign auxillaries like the Varangians, Catalans, or Heruli."
 byzthemata_desc:0 "The Themata armies are commanded by the Strategoi and conscripted from the Themes. These troops almost entirely consist of native Greeks from the countryside, and are larger and cheaper than the Tagmata."
 byzconstitution_desc:0 "The Empire, despite its absolute rule by the Basileius, runs on paper. The laws of the Romans have been codified over the centuries in scattered legal books, but now it is time to compile the most important of these laws into a constitution."
 byzsenate:0 "Delegate to the Synkletos"
 byzsenate_desc: "Historically, the Synkletos, the senate of our proud empire, had a myriad of functions and powers. It passed resolutions which the Emperor could adopt and issue as he pleased, suggested Imperial legislation and has even acted as a consultative body and judicial court. In recent centuries, this proud arm of our mighty government has been eroded and reduced to dust, but if we were to reintroduce it with our restored strength, embraced modernity and resurgent capacities, it could hail a new era of Imperial efficiency and civil fairness." 
 #Sicily
 sicsultanate:0 "Sultanate of Sicily"
 sicsultanate_desc:0 "The Sulatanate of Sicily maintains a rather absolute system of rule under Sharia law with the emir in charge of many state duties, but it is notable for its tolerance among Muslim realms with its many Christians and Jews populating Eastern Sicily and South Italy."
 sicitaliyya:0 "Sublime State of Italiyya"
 sicitaliyya_desc:0 "Through a long and hard fought campaign spanning several centuries, the original invaders of Sicily have managed to proclaim an empire in Italiyya.

 sicqadi:0 "Empower the Qadi"
 sicqadi_desc:0 "The Sultan carries the very important duty of appointing Qadi, or judges, for the various provinces of the state. These Islamic judges often solved local disputes and religious matters, allowing residents to sort things out peacefully with a mediator, and letting the Sultan not need to worry as much about direct administration."
 siccurrency:0 "Standardize the Currency"
 siccurrency_desc:0 "In the past, the Sultanate of Sicily used a single currency; the dinar which was introduced by the Arabic conquerors of the island. However, over time, many more new currencies such as Dirhems or Kharrubas, leading to unnecessary confusion and troubles with exchange rates. In order to get rid of this problem once for all, we shall introduce a single currency that shall be used throughout the entire Sultanate."
 sicreform:0 "The Land Reform"
 sicreform_desc:0 "Following the Islamic conquest of Sicily, land reforms were initiated to transform the island into a more Arabic system of governance. This resulted in many new and exotic crops being introduced to Sicily during the agricultural revolution, and smallholding farms being encouraged to increase productivity."
 sicrecruits:0 "Berber Recruits"
 sicrecruits_desc:0 "Though the Sultanate now rules over a largely Roman populace, the battle hardened armies of the Sultan are often recruited from across the Mediterranean in North Africa. While these armies tend to fight for gold and glory rather than the Sultanate, they are always loyal to the Sultan with little interest for local politics, caring more for fighting Christians in North Italy."
 sicfleet:0 "Expand the Fleet"
 sicfleet_desc:0 "Our position in the middle of the Mediterranean gives us the perfect chance to become a true ruler of the waves, controlling the naval routes from Balansiyah to Iskandariyya. The state shall fund the great expansion of our naval forces."
 sicitalo:0 "Italo-Arabic Governance"
 sicitalo_desc:0 "As our Arab and Islamic origins become more intertwined with local Italian customs, a distinct culture has coalesced in the ruling class of many of our cities. Through combining Italian and Arabic language, and adopting many of the traditional practices of each, this culture is sure to be of use in efficient communication among the ruling classes of the Sultanate. This is now also reflected in the upper class and administration of our country where many important positions are occupied by persons of Latin or Christian origins."
 sicgiama:0 "Giama'a Assembly"

As the Reconquista has finally ended, many Knights in their service have put forward the idea that they continue their service to God under our protection. Their skills, resources and expertise in warfare will certainly be useful in our future conquests. Most notably, the Knights of Santiago may be a valuable asset for our armies."

With the Umayyad Caliphate long out of memory, we now turn to further merging Church and State. By enacting a system of Patronage with Rome's assent, the Crown will be granted direct authority over the clergy and their appointments."
 ibepaternal:0 "Paternal and Absolute"
 ibepaternal_desc:0 "The people are much akin to a flock of sheep; easily frightened and misled. It is for this reason that the commoners cannot be trusted to lead themselves, and so the responsibility of state governance falls upon the Crown and its most loyal Council. Like a paternal figure, the Crown shall guide Iberia's subjects along a prosperous and devoutly Catholic path, protecting them from any harm that may lie in waiting. Then, too, shall the Crown remain as the Supreme authority in the nation; Absolute in their rule and regality as paramount sovereigns, Iberia's monarchs answer only to God above."
 ibecounciliberia:0 "Council of Iberia"
 ibecounciliberia_desc:0 "The State Councils of the various entities held in union by the Iberian Crown have administered their portions of the Empire separately from one another. Rather ashamedly, this has been done with comparatively little cooperation and cohesion when held up to the likes of England's Witenred or Francia's Estates General. Following in the footsteps of other centralised governing bodies, the realm shall henceforth be administered by a single Council of Iberia. This assembly will in turn answer only to His Majesty and, failing him, God."

These colonial heathens openly kneel before false idols and plot to bring about the empire's downfall.

 bultsardom_desc:0 "Bulgaria is well accustomed to the prestigious title of Tsardom - ever since Simeon the Great first proclaimed himself ''Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks", bulgarianizing the roman title of Caesar into Tsesar, or later Tsar, Bulgaria has hailed every single one of the rulers after him as Tsars no matter the state or size of our country at the time. When the brothers Asen revolted against the Romans to our south in 1185, it was only logical that they continue the legacy of the First Empire - this title grants prestige, good cause for continued attacks on the Romans, and a place on the world stage far above any of our South Slavic neighbours."

 bulliterary_desc:0 "The cultural Golden Age that lasted throughout Simeon the Great's reign was made possible because of his hospitality towards the many scholars and men of sciences that passed through the vast territories of Bulgaria at the time, some of which stayed and continued to pour their wisdom into the nation. Of course, we needed to preserve this knowledge so that it may be saved from the destructive sands of time. What the Tsar did was as such- he poured a considerable sum of money into building Literary Schools that would be used to house scholarly works and also be a place where commoners could go and get an introduction/education of the various sciences of the time. We would be wise to start the construction of the same types of schools so that our ever-growing population can hopefully learn from them and eventually push Bulgaria into another Golden Age. "
 bulkavkhan:0 "Reintroduce the Kavkhan"
 bulkavkhan_desc:0 "In the First Bulgarian Empire,  Kavkhan was a title that was given to the right hand of the Khan (Before Boris I converted Bulgaria to Christianity) and the Tsars - they would have a number of responsibilities and concentrated huge power and authority. The title was hereditary, a prominent boyar family would be picked generation after generation, and it was for life. The Kavkhan was also the commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Army and one of the primary diplomats of the country. Kavkhans were often regents or even co-rulers. Interestingly enough the Asen dynasty have not yet brought the title back into the Empire, regardless of the strength and stability that a loyal boyar in such a position would give."

Reintroducing such a body will first off, help the Bulgarian nobility and the Tsar find fast solutions to problems and unite to remove them, and second off, it will satisfy the nobles on their demand for representation in the administration of the realm. The Counsel may be a bit awkward at first regarding its dealings, but as soon as the task, the meaning, and purpose of the Council are understood by all participants, it will be a good guiding hand that will lead and shield Bulgaria from the problems it may run into.

Contrary to what may otherwise be assumed, though, Nizzar's Egypt is one of unprecedented cultural and religious tolerance and syncretism. Despite this, their ongoing diplomatic and trade rivalry with neighbouring Islamic powers has necessitated a certain... compromise. Lo and behold, the Abbasid dynasty, having fled Baghdad in the wake of the Mongol invasions, have made Cairo their home. Ultimately puppets of the Sultan residing in a gilded cage, the mere presence of the Abbasids nonetheless affords the House of Nizzar much prestige in both a political and spiritual sense."

After the Ptolemaic period the lands were further divided into administrative districts referred to as Nomes, which were governed by a Nomarch. With the Nizzarid state's need to further improve state function and their dogged syncretism of pre and post-Arab customs, an overhauled system based on the Nomarchy of old may be just what we need."

May our coffers never go empty again!"

While the Copts, Arabs, and other "free" groups have caused no trouble thusfar, the new generations of Mamluks are a magazine ready to detonate. The corvee system of old must be reworked and the role of the Mamluks in Egyptian harshly curbed, lest we end up weak like the Ayyubids. Through the gradual Egyptification and immediate disarmament of these slaves, they may yet learn their place in a Nizzarid world. They would evidently serve a better purpose improving infrastructure and agriculture while not at war, being granted permanent wages when called to act as fodder in our battles."

Though named after an Infidel "goddess", the idea itself may bear some weight in the reformed Nizzarid legal code. By implementing morality and common sense-based laws adapted from Ma'at, we can then arbitrate legal issues under Kenbets; courts run by village elders and - in extreme cases - the Vizier, or His Majesty himself. This would permit a decentralised justice system which would nonetheless be under the Sultan's thumb."

Veterans of the Varangian Guard returning to England are granted the closest seats to the Cyning due to their combat experience, with the tradition of gaining combat experience as a mercenary abroad taking precedence over simple recruitment or post-army specialisation.

Furthermore, the most learned men will be kept in the Cyning's company, so as to note down every facet of court life and the duties of rulership during each reign.

Despite this, they have also fallen into a great deal of debt to the Crown. By leveraging the economically dire straits of the six lords not on the throne, a number of laws can be instituted by which they shall be brought under heel. Deprived of the right to field their own military forces and police, forced to pay annual taxes to the Crown once again, and ceding all lands not directly part of residential estates to the Crown, the Heptarchs will no longer be a conceivable danger to anyone.

The Witen shall no longer hold legislative duties as they did in the Gemot or the Red which succeeded it; their post is to be one of an advisory nature, but permanent through and through.

The ever-growing irrelevance of the Witen outside of their role as royal advisors has also made the tradition of selecting a Cyning's successor somewhat of a humiliating affair for all involved. A radical new bill known as the Hereditary Succession Act shall abolish the last vestiges of the Witen's influence and furthermore the bastardised elective system within England. No more shall riled churls question whether they, too, could reign if it is succession by vote.

Our nomadic ancestors traveled on their backs with their flocks of sheep, goats and cattle over the immense plains of Mongolia and Central Asia.

This system caused a lot of tension and raised distrust amongst the non-Mongol inhabitants of the empire. If we wish to rebuild the mighty empire of our ancestors, we must ensure that the state is strong and unified, and such class system has no place in it."

Not all altars were permanent, but in many settled communities, the Tangse were permanent fixtures where offerings were made.

 georuisi_desc:0 "Zealotry is not all good and beneficial. In the past, the David the Builder found an adversary in the most unlikely of places- the clergy itself. Through treachery and opportunism present within the church, greedy traitors claimed great swathes of land within Georgia, effectively dividing the country. To prevent this crisis from repeating, we must heed the late David's wisdom and find the time to tighten the church's bonds, lest they break free."

While our Swedish brethren - those traitorous swines - may have abolished thralldom upon their conversion to Christianity, both Norway and our own kingdom have not done so yet, given how useful thralls are for rowing our ships.

Given that longships compose the bulk of our navy and waterborne transportation, the fact that these ships are obsolete to such a degree is, to say the least, an issue. We must modernize the longship, and we must do so promptly."

Unfortunately, these warriors are sometimes so blinded by their own rage that they are unable to tell friend from foe, and are more of a threat to their allies than to their enemies.

 crn_society_desc:0 "In an attempt to both distance themselves from their Anglo-Saxon oppressors and to create the fighting force that would be necessary to defend against them - not to mention to reclaim the British Isles from the Germanic tyrants eventually - the rulers of Cornwall have looked to the period of Roman rule of Britain for inspiration. Civil administration will be mixed with military command, and the magistrates of Cornish towns and villages will be expected to serve as militia commanders simultaneously. To ensure the defence and survival of the Cornish state, every community within the realm must be ready to muster arms and men at a moment’s notice, for none can know when the perfidious Angles will attack."
 crn_tinbaron:0 "Tin Barons"
 crn_tinbaron_desc:0 "Though deprived of the military leadership that most nobles across Europe enjoy, Cornish aristocrats have not found themselves entirely without influence and power. Many valuable tin deposits exist on land owned by Cornish nobles, granting them great wealth and prestige. Rather than being entrusted with control over the military, the aristocrats of Cornwall have increasingly relied upon for matters of industry, instead."
 crn_divide:0 "Divide et Impera"
 crn_divide_desc:0 "As Cornwall prepares to expand her borders, it once more looks to Rome as an example of how to handle newly conquered territories. For example, Cornwall would never be able to control the entirety of the island of Great Britain if it maintained the existing, massive polities of England and Scotland - they are simply too large for the much smaller Cornwall ever to hope to rein them in as-is. However, if Cornwall were to formally break England up into the Heptarchy or to break Scotland into local clans, these smaller entities would be much easier to govern. Such an example must be used no matter where Cornwall stakes its claim, lest the great territories she seeks to conquer overwhelm her ability to manage them."
 crn_foreign:0 "Foreign Bureaucrats"
 crn_foreign_desc:0 "There is too much land and not enough Cornishmen to administer all of it. The Brythonic people have been reduced in number over the centuries. The result is that the Cornish people are increasingly a minority among the population that Cornwall claims sovereignty over. No other choice is available. Cornwall must adapt its bureaucracy to allow its non-Cornish subjects to take civil and military positions, albeit under the watchful eye of their Cornish superiors. Maybe - if they learn the Cornish language and Cornish customs - they might even be allowed to be counted among proper Cornishmen?"
 crn_nothing:0 "Nothing Outside the Country"
 crn_nothing_desc:0 "There is no sovereign, nor are there commoners. There is no noble, nor are there peasants. There is no priest, nor are there merchants. There is only Cornwall and the citizens that serve her."
 crn_general:0 "The General Staff"
 crn_general_desc:0 "The Cornish sovereign exists for one reason, and for one reason only: to lead the Cornish military to victory and glory. Everything else is secondary. While God has divinely appointed the Cornish sovereign to fulfil that duty… Sometimes, the heavenly roll of the dice turns up a little bit short. The leading generals of the Cornish army will be granted the power to take control from the sovereign or overrule his decisions, depending upon the circumstances. No matter how much holy grace he has been blessed with, one man should be allowed to sink the Cornish ship of state all on his own."
 #Lotharingia
 lotfmelish:0 "Professionalise Flemish Pikemen"
 lotfmelish_desc:0 "The Flemish pike militias of the low countries have proven their use as an effective fighting force, particularly against the landed nobility. By modernizing and professionalizing them we can create a new loyal and strong pike army free of noble intervention."
 lotreform:0 "Reform the Missus Dominicus"
 lotreform_desc:0 "The Missus Dominicus is an old Carolingian official who is centrally appointed to supervise the administration and judicial goings-on of a province. Given our precarious geopolitical situation, we need to retain more control over the old noble magnates. By reestablishing the old office, we can hope to reduce corruption and increase our revenues."
 lotdutch:0 "Dutch Regiments"
 lotdutch_desc:0 "With our wealth limitless and our enemies encircling us, we must always evolve and adapt to defend our realm. The Dutch to our north have developed highly effective firing tactics and organization. By integrating these Dutch regiments into our army, we can continue to adapt and keep up with our rivals."
 lotculture:0 "Lotharingian Court Culture"
 lotculture_desc:0 "Situated on the crossroads of many cultures and empires, a unique culture amongst our elite has evolved. They speak an amalgamation of Dutch, Flemish, French, German, and English while being uniquely Lothairingian. By promoting this new culture we can not only strengthen our cohesion, but also communicate better with our neighbors."
 lotprinces:0 "The Merchant Princes"
 lotprinces_desc:0 "With staggering amount of wealth flowing into the low countries from the New World and Asia a new wealthy class has emerged. These new nobility have made their fortunes abroad and bought into the noble class. By using them as officials and Governors we can hope their entrepreneur spirit will rub off on our administration."
 lotbannum:0 "Revive the Bannum"
 lotbannum_desc:0 "Although we are more decentrilized state then we would like to admit, we do need a way to centralize power in case of a crisis. By reviving the Carolingian bannum, or imperial ban, we can create enough executive power to take charge should dire circumstances arise."
 lotstates:0 "Confederation of States"
 lotstates_desc:0 "We must embrace our identity as an amalgimation of many faiths, languages, feifdoms, and cities. By officially accepting this nature and signing into law a bill of federation, we can hope to strengthen ourselve internally through tolerance and unity."
 grh_ashen_horde_reform: "Ashen Horde"
 grh_ashen_horde_reform_desc: "The apocalypse is imminent! And it was our actions that have brought us this, even still, we must make Tengri proud. Whilst some weaklings would cower and fear for their end, we accept it! That does not mean we'll simply bow to it however, we'll rage against the dying of the light, we are not weak and we'll prove that to Tengri. Reduce all of Tengri's enemies to ash! Show them the power of the horde!"
