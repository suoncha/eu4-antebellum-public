The fighting was difficult; even with their backs pressed against the wall, the enemy stood firm. They knew what we were looking for, and they would die before they let our goals be met. Bodies began to pile, and our path became clear. When we found the High King, our soldiers brandished their weapons, forcing them to submit. We raised our hands to the skies in celebration, cheering the name of our new High King - long shall they reign!"

The fighting was difficult; even with our backs pressed against the wall, our brave soldiers stood firm. We knew what they were looking for, and we would die before they achieve their goals. Bodies began to pile, and our numbers began to dwindle. Those that remained saw the hopelessness of the cause. When they found our High King, their soldiers brandished their weapons and forced them to submit. We bowed our heads in shame, cursing the name of our new High King - may they die young and sick."

 hk_ire.4.t:0 "Collapse of the Irish High King"
 hk_ire.4.d:0 "As the treaties were signed and the bodies were buried, the old castle of the Irish High King was all that remained in his possession. His domains taken, His already unloyal Ruirechs seizing the opportunity to cut ties; with daggers pointing from all sides one is to wonder whether the scarred husk of what once was High King is worthy of being called such. In the end what matters is that He collapsed, opening new opportunities for more ambitious, and worthy clans to vie the title."

The banners and treasures from within were stripped down off the mantles that they hung on, ripped apart into tiny pieces, and tossed to the mud. Farmers and peasants were driven off the surrounding lands, while settlers came to found their new homes.

 hk_ire.6.d:0 "As we took the lands of the Welsh and the Highlanders, the nobles came to [Root.Monarch.GetName] and began to offer advice on how to rule this new land. They began to think that, perhaps, due to their shared relationship of being attacked by the English, that the Welsh and Highlanders could be more willing to join our administration. He quickly drafted up a new proclamation, and soon it was spoken about in every petty lord and fiefdom across the isles. The Gaelic community was welcome to come work with the Irish in their conquest of the English in exchange for wealth and power. Soon enough, messengers came pouring into our palace, offering [Root.Monarch.GetName] their aid and support."

 hk_ire.7.d:0 "In the years following the collapse of the English control of the south, old Gaelic-Norse families began to regain control of the port cities of Dubh Linn, Waterford, and Cork. While their triumph over the English was celebrated, there was still tension. The Norweigans continued to raid the coastline of the Irish, and with the Gaelic-Norse paying homage to their Norse Heritage, it created conflict between the both rural and urban Irish populations. This came to ahead with the rise of our Kingdom conquering all of the Ireland. Rumors abound, [Root.Monarch.GetName] practiced witchcraft, and sacrificed children to Odin and Thor! Although mostly spread by ambitious nobles wanting to weaken the authortiy over their overlord, their words have consequences. A small peasant group led by the young noble Seamus Meic Bráenáin came up to our keep and demanded a parle with our king. He demanded to know what plans the Ostmen, as he called it, had with the Irish. This issue had plagued [Root.Monarch.GetName] for many months now, and they had already drafted up a proposal for a new form of governance to end this conflict. However, he knew it could still be a complicated affair. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stroked their chin, before nodding their head and opening their mouth to speak."

The banners and treasures from within were quietly removed and replaced with new, foreign, banners.

The banners were set on fire, with no regard for their legacy, the ones found most beautiful were spared, and alongside timeless treasures were sent off to decorate a faraway court. Farmers and peasants were driven off the surrounding lands, while settlers came to found their new homes.

However, for the Irish, this seemed like a distant problem; it was on the continent, why must they deal with it? However, recently, conversions have begun to spread across the channel and into our islands. England and Scotland are falling to the revolution, and we are at risk too.

They lift their glasses and their spirits to the new ruler. However, as the crowd settles and begins to feast, they keep their eyes on their new High king. \n \nIn the Irish Peasant Revolt of the late 14th Century, the Norse-Gaels attempted to appeal to the Norweigans and Danes by calling upon their common cultural heritage. This act moved the nobility to start adopting old Norse customs and traditions, despite being firmly catholic and speaking a dialect of Irish. The Norse-Gaels have to maintain a delicate balance between their Nordic heritage and their current Irish identity, and each new ruler takes a different approach.

They would always find an excuse each year as to why they haven't spent hours upon end looking at dusty books, be it war, taxes, or rebellion. However, the monks have demanded that they come to the monestary and should we not, they would withdraw support.

Their weapons point at him, spears and sabers rattling as they draw nearer and nearer. He grimaces. This wasn’t what he signed up for. He was told he was to be sent off to fight in the Norse War, but he expected it to be a glorious fight for honor and for victory! This was just a fight in the mud. There was no honor here, just death and destruction. He avoided the two sabers headed for his chest, leaning to the side for one, and blocking the other. He kicked out his leg, pressing into their kneecap, and the enemy fell, screaming in pain. He lunged forward with his now free sword and jabbed it into the other’s neck. Taking a moment to breath, he looked over the battlefield. \n \nIt was pure chaos. Screams of men, the neighs of horses, the echoes of cannon fire. He looked back at the man rolling around in the mud: his knee was shattered. Slowly, he walked over, but heard the man muttering in some foreign tongue. While most was incomprehensible, he caught a word here and there. Mother. Father. Help. Heaven. This man was crying out to his family in Scandinavia, begging for someone to come save him. The soldier grimaced, and cut cleanly through his neck, ending his foe’s suffering. \n \nWhy was he here? Why was he fighting those who had the blood of Norsemen in them as well? [Root.Monarch.GetName], his lord, constantly called themselves a Nordic Gael, and yet, here they were, leading them into a fight with the very people they idolized and praised. It’s just insane, asinine, and…and… \n \nAnd then he saw them. Riding up on a horse, he saw [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] cut down a Scandinavian with a single strike.

Do not falter!\" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] called over the battlefield, and all our soldiers turned to look at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. \"These men are our brothers, yes, but we cannot forgive them! They do not follow the true path! We are not just Irishmen, nor are we just Norse Gael; We are all children of the Heavenly Father!\" [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] shouted, screaming at the top of their lungs with a powerful, commanding voice. The soldier got up, gripping his blade tightly and gritting his teeth. \"We shall force them to submit, but not to us, but to the only one who can command us! To Christ, who forgives us, who protects, who shall ask us to kneel before them when Judgement Day comes! \" The soldier began to charge forward, spotting a Norseman aiming a musket at his lord. \"It is not a war to conquer, it is a war to save! Our brothers have lost their way, and they must return! Either on their own…\" [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blade high, catching the sun's reflection. \"…Or through the might of our holy blades!\" The soldier jabbed his sword into the Norseman’s head, and they crumpled to the ground.

Take lords and ladies from the home country and give them titles in the new city, to ensure that it will remain in our grasp. While this seems like a solid idea, it would also spark massive uprising from the local nobilitas.

These Brittonic Revivalists were scoffed at by most as delusional, as fools that were pretending to be something they were not. However, some found this idea interesting, specifically the nobility who liked to dress themselves in titles and names as to feel more regal. Common folk cared little for it, as these prancing nobles still spoke Welsh or whatever language they were native to. Recently, however, the idea has seen another massive surge in popularity, spreading throughout the growing middle class and cities, with hundreds of thousands now calling themselves "Britons". This has been causing tensions with those who view the idea as ridiculous, and among those who are not Welsh, it is considered even more confusing and angering. Our lord, [Root.Monarch.GetName], pondered what to do about this growing movement, eventually deciding to sponsor and support this new movement, calling themselves a True Briton.
