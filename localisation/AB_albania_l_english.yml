The crushing blow dealt by the Bulgars in the 9th century left us a shadow of our former selves, withering in [4174.GetName], only to be finished off by the opportunistic, mercantilist Venetians. As the turn of the mid-century approaches, the Balkan powderkeg is once more ready to blow; with the Byzantines humiliated by the rising Tsardom, they will be seeking revenge sooner or later. While the Bulgarians are suitably occupied, the Albanian volunteers will need to be well-trained in order to resist a large and daunting force and secure independence." #4174 is Durres
 alb_greater_title:0 "Greater Albania"
 alb_greater_desc:0 "As we have established a stable foothold along the western highlands of the Balkan peninsula, the Albanians living as minorities outside Albania proper from the times of Illyria are now flocking to us in droves. Many will support our cause, by joining the military or assisting in gaining footholds across the Balkans."
 alb_heir_title:0 "Heirs of the Romans"
 alb_heir_desc:0 "Byzantine Greek culture was the most prevalent during our time under subjugation by different overlords, adopting their governing style, inheriting many traditions and military administration. As of this day, the Albanian identity has had a resurgence, while the repeated expeditions by the Bulgars, Venetians and Nicaeans into Byzantine lands have left them devastated and bankrupt. It is time Greece be put under new, revitalised ownership."
 alb_greece_title:0 "Invade Greece"
 alb_greece_desc:0 "With Greece divided between many different administrations, their people have been unable to mount a proper resistance against their subjugators. The Arvanites, Albanians living in Greece and assimilating into the local culture have especially lent their aid as reconnaissance units. Let us aid them and liberate Greece from foreign hands."
 alb_aegean_title:0 "Aegean Domination"
 alb_aegean_desc:0 "The Aegean Sea is home to one of the ancient trade routes of the Silk Road; either to reach Constantinople or to continue onwards towards Italian ports. By controlling both sides of the Aegean through the Archipelagos Islands and their ports, we can launch patrol fleets against piracy, control a large share of trade and enrich the royal coffers immensely."
 alb_slavs_title:0 "Strike Against the Slavs"
 alb_slavs_desc:0 "The Slavic Kingdoms surrounding us have controlled the Balkans for far too long. With the Byzantines a distant memory, we are the last stronghold standing against the expansionist Bulgarians. While they are occupied with consolidating their hold over their newly occupied lands, let us march along the Danube and raze their heartland!"
 alb_western_title:0 "Control West Balkans"
 alb_western_desc:0 "The Croats to our north still conspire with the Latins and Franks to destroy us. We will not let them sell their eternal souls for trivial worldly politics! They must be shown the light, even if by force."
 alb_romania_title:0 "Cross the Danube"
 alb_romania_desc:0 "The Romanian Vlachs and Moldovans remain one of the most strange cultures in the region. Their language and culture are closer to that of Latin and other Romance offshoots over the dominant Slavic identity in Eastern Europe, isolating them from the majority of their neighbours. The fertile farmlands are irrigated by the Danube River, which also presents itself as a natural defence line against northern incursions. Romania is an ideal region for Albania to expand into and develop in the future."
 alb_military_title:0 "Military Revitalization"
 alb_military_desc:0 "If we are to unshackle ourselves from being a minor pawn in the battle for control of the Balkans, we must recruit and reform our army into a much more intimidating force. Let us take in all able volunteers, and supplement them with local mercenaries to revitalise the Albanian army!"
 alb_eagle_title:0 "The Eagle Flies Again"
 alb_eagle_desc:0 "The numerous wars waged across the Balkans have given the Albanian military administration precious experience in fighting much larger forces with a smaller, compact army. Even as we expand our army and are no longer fighting more numerous foes, that knowledge has encouraged a new way of thinking; in establishing a more disciplined, professional fighting force."

 alb_navy_title:0 "Forca Detare"
 alb_navy_desc:0 "With the majority of the western Balkans being rugged terrain and full of treacherous mountain fortifications, land invasions from the north under the threat of the Germans and Italians are almost impossible. On the other hand, the ports along the Adriatic Sea are prime naval invasion targets for the large navies employed by the Italian merchant states. We must counteract this threat by building our own naval flotilla, a Forca Detare."

 alb_identity_title:0 "Promote Our Identity"
 alb_identity_desc:0 "To the glee of our enemies, we have never been a unified people. We have been pulled back and forth between Romans, Greeks, Franks, and Venetians, all for the hope of holding a meagre position of power just maybe one year longer. But with our newfound success, and perhaps some pressure of our own, we can unite the fractured principalities of our nation behind one cause: for that of an Albanian nation!"

 alb_ottomans_title:0 "Deals with the Ottomans"
 alb_ottomans_desc:0 "Striking deals with merchants is always an enormous pain - especially with one as established as the Osmans & Sons Co., the Byzantine court deigning them the honour of their own, dedicated Bazaar in the heart of [151.GetName]. A trade empire headed by the Osman family and their retainers, they hire the most cutthroat merchants, and the mercenary groups to match. Only when Osman's Bazaar has been reopened will they deem us worthy to trade with. If they don't, we can introduce them to a little thing called A Sultan Battery..."

 alb_pannonia_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Control Pannonia[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_pannonia_desc:0 "The Magyars of Carpathia are a plague upon Eastern Europe. Originally migrating from the east, they ravaged the countryside wherever they traversed, at the apparent behest of their bloody sky gods. It was only until they were brutalised by the similarly migrating Bulgars that they somewhat calmed their destructive tendencies. Even now, they are an eyesore. Christians and other Pagans alike would love to see them destroyed - and we shall happily take their fertile lands for ourselves."

 alb_embrace_new_faith_desc:0 "The Roman Orthodox Church has never been in such disunity. The Kievan Rus suffered a death by a thousand cuts, shattering against the onslaught of the Golden Horde. Meanwhile, the former Patriarchate of Bulgaria now sits from a position of strength, estranged from the head in Constantinople, with the Patriarchates of Alexandria, Jerusalem and Antioch entirely out of reach. Centuries have passed, yet Orthodox believers have had little time to focus on matters of faith. Attempts to bring Catholicism to the Balkans have met with scorn and disdain - though that may be Venetian avarice and their traitorous character. If we were to embrace this new faith, we could potentially wield enormous power within the clerical circles in Eastern Europe as the bastion of Catholicism."
 alb_catholic_alliances_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Catholic Confraternity[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_catholic_alliances_desc:0 "The Catholic cause is only as strong as its weakest links - a single dim-witted individual can bring down the entire faith and its regional presence. The Battle of Valencia is evidence enough of this; Catholicism in Eastern Europe can only persist with our strength at the helm. The Papal States are too busy dealing with a Mad King and the shadow of Sicily, while we can consider neither the Venetians nor Genoans can for such a responsibility, what with their propensity to sell the True Cross rather than worship it - but they have their uses..."
 alb_latin_empire_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB]Proclaim the Latin Empire[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_ALB_end]"
 alb_latin_empire_desc:0 "The Latin Empire once had a strong presence across the Mediterranean. Nizzarid militarisation hindered Catholic presence in Alexandria and now threatens an Islamic takeover of the Holy City of Jerusalem. Before we can even imagine landing in Asia Minor to relieve the Crusader states from impending doom, we must deal with the Schism besetting this side of the Aegean. The Patriarchate of Constantinople holds significant power in the region, and if we convince them to accept Catholicism once and for all, we can settle the religious conflict permanently."

 ab_albania.3.d:0 "An Albanian noble by the name Gjergj 'Skanderbeg' of House Kastrioti, first distinguished himself in the training regiments as an inspiration to those around him. Educated in the Nicaean Military Academy, Gjergj gained experience in several campaigns under the Nicaean banner against the Byzantines, as well as campaigns in Anatolia to consolidate Nicaean hold on the region. After the Nicaeans brokered an unsteady peace deal with the Angelid court, Gjergj returned to his home in Lezhë, where he established the League of Lezhë, a small group of nobles set on achieving Albanian independence. With Albanian independence now achieved - a large part apportioned to him, Gjergj is the highest-ranking officer in the army who is also of noble standing.

While our mighty navy ensures our island ports are not threatened by the barbaric horde of Bulgars, our only mainland holding in [4174.GetName] will be under threat, from both Albanian rebel incursions and Bulgarian invasions alike.

As one of the first large groups of people to inhabit the region, alongside the Thracians and the Greeks, the Illyrian identity spans across the majority of the western highlands that form the spine of the Balkans and oversees the Adriatic. Although most of the Illyrian customs have been lost during the chaos of the Dark Ages, some are still preserved by word of mouth. They were a strong seafaring people with a predilection to pirate merchant fleets, seen as unpredictable, turbulent and warlike by the Greco-Romans. With emerging threats from all sides, this is perhaps a reputation that we could use to our advantage. In any case, the Illyrian identity is one that only we, of the Albanian people, can truly reclaim."

We will lay our traps, place our men, and wait for the enemy to come to us. The Bulgarian armies will boldly march into the valleys and gorges of our home, only to be turned away, retreating home with their tails tucked between their legs.."
 alb_third:0 "Kingdom of Albania"
 alb_third_desc:0 "For ages our lands have been divided and ruled by the foreigners. Our people never had the desire or opportunity to create their own state, ruled by Albanians. But the tide of history is changing. As the mighty empires around us fall, and their influence over us dwindles, we have the opportunity to throw off the chains that bind us down and forge our own destiny."
 alb_fourth:0 "Hit and Run"
 alb_fourth_desc:0 "Albania is not a particularly large or powerful country. That doesn't mean that we won't fight when foreign invaders come to steal our lands. We have centuries of experience fighting off invaders and a fantastic understanding of how to best use our land's terrain to our advantage when fighting off these invaders. We don't follow traditional military tactics and march our men into valleys to have them face the enemy head on - we take to the hills, confuse the enemy, and ambush their supply chain. Before they realise what’s hit them, we vanish into thin air, waiting for the next time they march into our home!"

 alb_sixth:0 "Albanian Tolerance"
 alb_sixth_desc:0 "Our people find themselves at a crossroads of faith. Stuck between Pope and Patriarch, with the followers of Allah hounding us, it is clear we have to align our beliefs to one or the other. Regardless of our decision however, we shouldn’t alienate those who do not follow our course, as regardless of our faith we are all still Albanian above all."
 alb_seventh:0 "Break The Power Of Princes"
 alb_seventh_desc:0 "Our Land was divided and ruled by local princes, who were preoccupied with their own advancement. If we want to create a modern state, we must rid ourselves of these princes and impose a single central will and rule to help guide our people towards a brighter future."
