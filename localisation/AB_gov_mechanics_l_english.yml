 byzantine_decadence_desc:0 "The Roman Empire is but a mere shell of its former self, a shadow of the glorious state that once stretched across the Mediterranean. While there is no one single cause for the collapse of the Empire, there is one family that keeps pushing the empire closer and closer towards total destruction, albeit unintentionally. The Angelos dynasty, which has been ruling over Byzantium since the 12th Century, have showcased the military incompetence, corruption, overspending, and a complete disregard for state maintenance that the Byzantine Empire has come to be known for. If Byzantium is to survive the centuries to coming, they must rebuild their broken state, reform their military, and prevent further incursions from rivals, lest they fall just as the west did.\n\nYou can lower your §YDecadence§! level by completing mission in the §YAngelid Crisis§! mission tree branch.\n"

 nicene_militarized_society_desc:0 "For all of Greek history, threats have encroached upon the Hellenic world - sometimes even from within. A plethora of Greek cultures that have come before, such as the Spartans and Macedons, have prided themselves on elements of militarism that lay in wait, ready to erupt at a moment's notice. Today, this reflects in the idea of the Nicene Stratocracy - a governing order comprised entirely of our military elites, a 'warrior state', which can reconfigure its level of oversight and control over society according to the needs of the war effort. No longer a state with an army - but an army with a state."
