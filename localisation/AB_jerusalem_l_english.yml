 koj_crusader_alliances_title:0 "Crusader Alliances"
 koj_crusader_alliances_desc:0 "Strangers in a strange land, we may think ourselves alone. This could not be further from the truth - the Lord is our shepherd. He shall keep tight-knit his flock. We need only have faith and reach out."
 koj_young_lion_title:0 "Face the Young Lion"
 koj_young_lion_desc:0 "Alliances and swords alike have been forged in anticipation of Muslim wrath. At last, it is here - our armies stare boldly into the jaws of Abdul Jabaar's great heathen horde. Let us not shy away - against the unfaithful and unworthy, we shall test our swords!"
 koj_gather_army_title:0 "Gather the Army"
 koj_gather_army_desc:0 "Not all hope is yet lost. Though we may be an oasis, our waters run deep. The restless potential warriors of our humble and holy kingdom - of men young and old, novice and tried - are rearing for purpose. Let us call our men to the defence of Christendom!"
 koj_triumph_cross_title:0 "The Triumph of the Cross"
 koj_triumph_cross_desc:0 "By the glory of God, miraculous victory has come upon us. The Holy Land glimmers with light - the Oases sing with praise. The foul and wretched Nizzarid bloodline flees before the pounding of our hooves. Deus Vult!"
 koj_reclaim_holy_land_title:0 "Reclaim the Holy Land"
 koj_reclaim_holy_land_desc:0 "By the Lord's will, the Holy Land must belong in Christian hands. Though the infidels may have seen it despoiled, we may see it prosper. By the holy word, these lands may yet see the light!"
 koj_fate_nonbelievers_title:0 "Fate of the Non-Believers"
 koj_fate_nonbelievers_desc:0 "The Holy Land and the wastes beyond are rife with non-believers. Followers of faiths unholy, unjust, and outright bizarre, file through the marketplaces. Wild and untamed pagan gods defile, as do the treacherous words of Muhammad. The good word teaches tolerance - but should we let these lost souls suffer in ignorance when they could instead know the good shepherd?"
 koj_king_doge_title:0 "The Doge and the King"
 koj_king_doge_desc:0 "The Venetians have long been masters of the sea - masters best-kept allies. The quality of their craft is unmatched and their reputation is impressive. However, their tendency towards selfishness and greed can often render the serene republic a wildcard - siding with heathens in an instant should it benefit them. What course shall we take against such a temperamental power?"
 koj_land_of_moses_title:0 "The Land of Moses"
 koj_land_of_moses_desc:0 "Egypt - the ancient land of the pharaohs, from which Moses and his flock fled - lays in the hands of a dynasty foul and undeserving. The dreaded Nizzarids, descendants of some brute named Nizzar, reign supreme over the Nile and its engulfing deserts and serve as our greatest threat. To oust them once and for all, their stranglehold over Egypt must be brought to an end!"
 koj_sheba_title:0 "Queen of Sheba's Land"
 koj_sheba_desc:0 "Deep in the heart of Eastern Africa, wild, untamed and ferocious mountain lands await. Warriors and river valleys bountiful and bold yearn for our guidance and wisdom. Should we bring them our holy insight and perfect interpretation of the ancient scriptures, we could overturn their strange ways and make them tried and tested warriors of the cross!"
 koj_fate_of_islam_title:0 "Fate of Islam"
 koj_fate_of_islam_desc:0 "A foul, malevolent and monstrous force has befallen the world - that of Islam, the accursed submission to the so-called prophet Muhammad. This wicked force has overrun lands once devout and saved. No longer, we say - the Holy Lands, the Levant, the Maghreb, they all shall know Christ! Makkah shall burn and know the cross."
 koj_levantine_domination_title:0 "Levantine Domination"
 koj_levantine_domination_desc:0 "It is only right that all of the Levant - its fertile crescent and all of its beautiful rivers - come before Christ. The fool Muhammad has managed to lead astray many a Levantine population, but no longer. Christian brothers from all over shall rejoice and see their sons and daughters prosper. From the Sinai to the Euphrates, Israelites to Elamites, Jesus shall be known!"
 koj_seleucia_title:0 "Patriarchate of Seleucia"
 koj_seleucia_desc:0 "Mesopotamia is a land ancient and wise. Before Christ even walked the Earth, these lands were rich, fertile and wise. Recent centuries have rendered a region renowned as a barbarous, unhinged and unloved wasteland - a cradle of bastardisation, not civilisation. Let us establish, according to the footsteps and precedent of past conquerors, the Patriarchate of Seleucia, to bring Christ's word to these vile lands!"
 koj_timur_title:0 "In Timur's Footsteps"
 koj_timur_desc:0 "Sad as it is, some lands are simply destined to be conquered. Foul and evil marauders have ravaged these ancient and proud mountain domains, these secluded oasis retreats, and these humble desert enclaves, to the point where they patiently await new conquerors and ready themselves for more oppression. No more! Christ offers freedom. The shepherd leads - he does not oppress! Through His forgiveness, we know freedom. So too shall Persia!"
 koj_patriarchate_alexandria_title:0 "Patriarchate of Alexandria"
 koj_patriarchate_alexandria_desc:0 "Blessed Alexandria, founded by the mighty Alexander, once a beating heart of the early Church, has laid in the hands of the heathens for too long. The Patriarchate must be restored!"
 koj_granary_title:0 "Granary of the Mediterranean"
 koj_granary_desc:0 "The blessed lands of Egypt have for many centuries provided bountiful crops to those within. Gilded grains, bountiful blossoms and wistful waters have provided prosperity and riches since the beginning of time. We would be fools to not see these fertile deltas reach their full potential, free of warfare and heathen treachery. Let the Nile sing!"
 koj_contol_trade_title:0 "Control the Naval Trade"
 koj_contol_trade_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the Mediterranean, for many centuries now, has fallen beneath the shady and vile veil of heathen supremacy. Muslims and worse have taken up arms and sails alike to seek prosperity on Mediterranean shorelines. No more! With our newfound strength, we shall vanquish their greed and bring about prosperity in the name of the righteous Lord!"
 koj_rebuild_the_fleet_title:0 "Rebuild the Fleet"
 koj_rebuild_the_fleet_desc:0 "At our doorstep lays the gilded, prosperous, beautiful Mediterranean. We would be fools to neglect her serene waters. Let us make haste - these waves must be conquered and cultivated!"
 koj_rhodes_title:0 "Unite with Hospitallers"
 koj_rhodes_desc:0 "The humble Knights of Rhodes have fallen upon hard times. No more! Let us correct this disastrous course and bring them under our wing. With their ferocious zeal at our side, we shall see the Mediterranean vanquished in the name of the Lord!"
 koj_legions_of_christendom_title:0 "Legions of Christendom"
 koj_legions_of_christendom_desc:0 "The armies of Christ can never truly rest, not while heathens and heretics still threaten the faithful. Should a threat big enough appear that could threaten both our existence, and the existence of the church as a whole, then it is our sacred duty to God and Christ to annihilate the armies of the damned. A Grand Crusade shall be called to destroy the threats once and for all."
 koj_global_crusade_title:0 "The Grand Crusade"
 koj_global_crusade_desc:0 "The time is right, the prayers have been read aloud in front of our brave soldiers. All that remains is for us to crush the heathens that dare challenge almighty God. This endeavour will take the greatest military minds and bravest men to see through, but God will not allow us to falter." 
 koj_seljuk_title:0 "Defeat Seljuk's Descendants" 
 koj_seljuk_desc:0 "The Seljuks were once the scourge of Christendom, and their initial invasion of the holy land is what triggered the initial crusades. Now, the Seljuks and their splinter states are mere shadows of their once grand empire. It would be God’s work to wipe them off the face of the map." 
 koj_avenge_fourth_crusade_title:0 "Avenge the Fourth Crusade"
 koj_avenge_fourth_crusade_desc:0 "The unfortunate failure of the Fourth Crusade was a major tactical blunder in the history of the crusades. The Crusaders had almost conquered the city of the world's desire for the Pope, but poor planning and even poorer tactics resulted in a staggering defeat. Now that we are the main force of a renewed crusade, we can rectify the failures of the past for a better future for Christianity." 
 koj_latin_empire_title:0 "The Latin Empire" 
 koj_latin_empire_desc:0 "The Empire of the Romans in the East has always been heretical in the eyes of the true followers of Christ. The mighty Eastern Roman Empire has now fallen from grace, and our continued conquests in the east have granted us some legitimacy as the successor to the old empire. The Pope has approached offering us an opportunity to crown our ruler as the true ruler of the Roman Empire in the East." 
 koj_outremer_nation_title:0 "The Outremer Nation" 
 koj_outremer_nation_desc:0 "A major cultural shift has occurred in our lands. Instead of being a land of Arabs ruled over by the French, it is now a land of a new culture referred to by outside historians as Outremer. Mixtures of customs and languages are all tied together by a common faith in Catholicism. Expanding this new culture into our administration and to our lands will unite these once disunited lands." 
 koj_crusader_fortifications_title:0 "Crusader Fortifications"
 koj_crusader_fortifications_desc:0 "Our lands are filled with we people who do not enjoy being ruled by us, and our neighbours all seek to destroy our kingdom. Maintaining our current amount of forts will only lead to inevitable downfall. Forts must be constructed and developed across the land to ensure that we do not fall to both inwards strife and outwards invasion." 
 koj_krak_des_chevaliers_title:0 "Krak des Chevaliers"
 koj_krak_des_chevaliers_desc:0 "The lands of Tripoli are the most defensible position in all of the Holy Land. The location is perfect for us to finance and construct the grandest series of fortifications and defences known to God. No Saracen will ever dare invade us once they see our awe-inspiring might." 
 koj_cultivate_the_holy_land_title:0 "Cultivate the Holy Land"
 koj_cultivate_the_holy_land_desc:0 "Centuries of crusading has turned the Holy Land into devastated hellscape comparable to the lands of England back in Europe. And while the conversion of the locals has been mostly successful, they still whine and complain about the abysmal standard of living. Giving minor concessions and ensuring that there are farms for them to work on to make a living might revitalise our economy." 
 koj_markets_of_tyre_title:0 "Markets of Tyre" 
 koj_markets_of_tyre_desc:0 "The city of Tyre was once the producer of the legendary Tyrian Dye that was desired by even the grandest of rulers in antiquity. Although the dye trade has since fallen off, the city still has some infrastructure to become the biggest port in the Mediterranean. It just takes a little investment and advertising and then the profits will start rolling in." 
 koj_jewel_of_orient_title:0 "Jewel of the Orient" 
 koj_jewel_of_orient_desc:0 "Jerusalem is the most significant city in the Near East, unfortunately, it is dwarfed in size compared to other major metropolises across the world. It deserves a proper renovation to truly be considered the capital of the Kingdom of God. New churches, markets, and workshops will launch it into the future of urbanisation and industrialisation."
 koj_holy_sepulchre_title:0 "Church of the Holy Sepulchre" 
 koj_holy_sepulchre_desc:0 "The holiest of all churches in Catholicism is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and while it is sacred to all Christians, it is a tad small compared to other churches in the world. While we could go and build a new church and tear down the old one and claim it was in the wrong place, it would look better in the eyes of God if we gave the old church a renovation to bring it up to par with other cathedrals." 
 koj_holy_alliance_title:0 "Forge the Holy Alliance" 
 koj_holy_alliance_desc:0 "The most holy nation on the planet is the Papal States themselves in Rome. To truly feel closer to God and to bring his vision to life on Earth, we must consult with the pope and ensure that our plans align to better the life of Catholics everywhere." 
 koj_invite_western_scholars_title:0 "Invite Western Scholars"
 koj_invite_western_scholars_desc:0 "Scholars back home in the West have thought up some new philosophies and ideas during our time crusading. Some of these ideas are questionably Pagan in nature, but they also produce beautiful paintings and provide better ways to organise a state. So we will have to cherry-pick what works and what we do not want, but we cannot deny these ideas." 
 koj_patronize_art_title:0 "Patronise Religious Art" 
 koj_patronize_art_desc:0 "The artistry of the Renaissance is the most beautiful that anyone has laid eyes upon. A few fools damned to hell have painted paintings of Pagan gods who defy Christ. As a response, we will commission one hundred paintings depicting stories from the Bible and the life of Jesus for every one of their so-called masterpieces about Venus." 
 koj_colleges_title:0 "Pontifical Colleges" 
 koj_colleges_desc:0 "Universities that can teach our heirs and other important government magistrates the ways of Christ and rulership will greatly increase our capabilities to conquer heathens. There is no shortage of learned men in the Kingdom, we just have to bring them together." 
 koj_interfaith_unity_title:0 "Interfaith Unity" 
 koj_interfaith_unity_desc:0 "It would be impossible for us to truly remove the stain of the Saracens from our lands. They are just too stubborn to ever give in. Perhaps it would be better to accept these differences and bring all peoples of our Kingdom together to strengthen our realm against invaders. After all, we are all sons of Abraham"

 ab_jerusalem.5.d:0 "At last, elusive Anatolia and its beating heart, the City of the World's Desire, belong to the good and Christian world once more. Even as we deliberate and celebrate, work is still being done - Saracen idols being cast down, churches propped up, faithful Christian nobles raising their banners, all in the pursuit of making these lands pure once more. As the work goes on, however, we wonder whether it is best to delegate our newest acquisition to our finest young nobles, modestly reviving the old memory of the Latin Empire as to alleviate ourselves of administrative burden, or proudly incorporate Constantinople into our growing crown..."

 ab_jerusalem.6.t:0 "Fate of Islam"
 ab_jerusalem.6.d:0 "'Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth' - so said Christ in his sermon on the Mount of Beatitudes. Over a thousand years later, we stand here today gazing out over the Holy Lands we have waged a bitter war to acquire and wonder if we are truly the meek that he spoke of. Are they meek, the powerful men who unsheathe their blade only in eager response, ready to vanquish evil so that it may never have to be unsheathed again? Or are they not the wise men who choose peace first, keeping their blades still in their scabbards, hoping that the innocent may prove themselves innocent, regardless of creed? Today, we must decide - is Islam a monstrous enemy, or an error to be treated with mercy and acceptance, brothers loved regardless?"
 ab_jerusalem.6.a:0 "Today, the Cross triumphs over the Crescent"
