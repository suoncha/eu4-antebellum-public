 SLU_second: "Baltic Fleet"
 SLU_second_desc: "The riches of our lands have long flowed from the ships of the Baltic, however the ships have often not been Kalevalian, but foreign. If we are to wrest full control of our lands back, we must establish our own Baltic fleet."
 SLU_third: "Between Rus' and Vikings"
 SLU_third_desc: "Our lands lie between two ferocious people, the Rus' and the Norse, yet neither were able to fully conquer us in times past. The Kalevalian war spirit has proved far too strong for even the most brutal conqueror."
 SLU_fourth: "Estonian Naval Captains"
 SLU_fourth_desc: "The Estonians have had naval traditions going back almost as long the Norse. It is no secret that they have defended their coasts from all manner of pirates and barbarian in part due to their experienced naval leaders. We should use the Estonians for our own fleet, and once and for all strike down the Norse raiders for good."
 SLU_fifth: "Hakkaa Päälle!"
 SLU_fifth_desc: "Hakkaa Päälle or strike them down, is the battle of our esteemed Finish light cavalry. While excellent at skirmishing, scouting, and raiding, it is with their dreaded charge that they strike terror into the hearts of our enemies. With them guarded our flanks, none shall oppose us on the battlefield."
 SLU_sixth: "Ärkamisaeg"
 SLU_sixth_desc: "Long have our people been distant and unknown to most of the world. However, now is the time that our great nation shall have a national awakening, with art, literature, and songs that will forever remind both us and distant people of the glory of Kalevalia."

 SLU_seventh_desc: "Even in the most extreme circumstances our people will always survive. Armed with a tenacity few others can boast,would be invaders will only find one thing certain, a pale and white death."

 krz_first: "Hammer of Perkunas"
 krz_first_desc: "Old Father, God of Thunder! When nature speaks, it is through your voice. When lightning crashes against the ground, it is your will and yours alone that guides their strikes. Your warriors shall paint their shields and their armors with your symbols, your callings. They shall be your finest men; not to murder and pillage like those vicious, blood-thirsty Christians, but to defend the world so generously gifted to us. Every warrior will fight with the fury of thunder, and the deafening crash of blades and spears that follow in their wake!"
 krz_second: "Great Deeds and Good Faith"
 krz_second_desc: "To those of great Christian Europe, what do they have to show for their piety and devotion to their one God? A legacy of violence and barbarism! We tend to our cities, nestled deep within our forests, while legions of maddened young men march to their doom for fractured kingdoms and duchies. We will be better. Our cause is righteous, and all will know the will of the gods - we shall not make a desert and call it peace, but create a garden of piety for our realm."
 krz_third: "Vanquisher of Slavs"
 krz_third_desc: "Lo, the sons of Rus! Divided, they cannot stand against our tide. Fallen, they join as a multitude of peoples under our empire. Their resistance is stiff, but as they are many, we must treat them with a gentler hand. For a while, their language and cultures will remain - perhaps even their deluded faith, until tensions simmer and no longer does the sound of bloody warfare ring across the plains and forests of this land. Only when they understand that our rule is total will they bend the knee, in understanding that we shall forevermore be the masters of this place."
 krz_fourth: "Hegemon of Krievzeme"
 krz_fourth_desc: "Never again will this realm be known as its plenitude of names. Its false titles - of Rus' and Ruthenia, will be eradicated. Krievzemia shall remain! Every corner of our empire, from the smallest villages to the sprawling metropolises, will know who their new masters are. They are not the children of that 'one true God', but the servants of many! In time, the Slavic peoples will become unto us, at long last united under a single banner."
 krz_fifth: "River Trade Routes"
 krz_fifth_desc: "With our ever-growing empire, what follows suit is the inevitable rebirth and redoubling of trade. We possess resources in abundance, and it is no surprise at all that wealth pours in from all directions. Muslim merchants in the East make little distinction between Christians and Romuva, as one has replaced the other, and even those in the West, who decry us as barbarians, now happily travel to the gates of our resplendant capital, seeking whatever we can provide. We will be this beacon between worlds."
 krz_sixth: "Integration of the Kazakhi"
 krz_sixth_desc: "These Christian Slavic men of the south, in those wild fields south of Krievzemia, have remained a thorn in the side of all invaders ever since their inception. Neither the Golden Horde nor the shattered remnants of Rus' could tame them. We, however, are an overwhelming force. Just as easily we could root out these parasites and burn them away from our lands, but it would do us no good. An offer, then: these Kazakhi will join us, their cavalry joining ours, so long as they convert."
 krz_seventh: "Saule's Champions"
 krz_seventh_desc: "O, Saule, you who are the giver of warmth! Who tends to our crops and ensures that our lives are well and prosperous! As your chariot rides across the sky, know that each warrior will lay down their life so that we continue to believe in everything you have done for us. Saule, matriarch of the universe, caretaker of all! Our army will defend our faith in beloved Saule, for we know we are unshakeable, unbreakable, unstoppable!"
 #Decisions
 form_krievzemia_title: "Form Krievzemia"
 form_krievzemia_desc: "For centuries, the Christians of Europe have battered at our gates. So many times have they attempted to tear us out from our homes, burning our lands, our people, that they recant their faith, and even their very language. It was often believed that we were destined for oblivion, for what gods would allow their faithful to fall so far, so deep into defense that there can never be even the smallest thought of truly living, but rather staving off death another day?/n/nOur downfall ends here! Not another moment will pass where the blood of our brothers and sisters will be spilled in a desperate act of delaying the inevitable. Latvia, her land, her people, has experienced a miraculous turnabout. It shall no longer be the age of Christian domination, but the return of Saule's light! Long live Krievzemia!"
 form_kalevalia_title: "Form Kalevalia"
 form_kalevalia_desc: "The enemy encroaches upon our forests and lakes from every direction. From the east, the Rus' press ever westward. From the north and west, the Norsemen raid and settle our coasts. From the south, crusaders march with fire and iron, seeking to shatter our ancient ways. No longer shall the tribes of the Finnic people remain scattered and divided. We must stand as one, not as clans, but as a nation. Let the world know this name: Kalevalia. The eternal land of song and steel!"

 smi_destroy_the_oppressors_title: "Destroy the Oppressors"
 smi_destroy_the_oppressors_desc: "The vile heathen have invaded our lands and desecrated our holy places. Their effort to destroy us has forced us to abandon our peaceful way of living and now, the time for vengeance has come."
 smi_noaidi_title: "Blessing of the Noaidi"
 smi_noaidi_desc: "The Noaidi, the Shamans who serve as the medium between the Realm of the Living and the Dead, form a very influential part of our society. Their ritualistic drums bestow upon them the ability to communicate with benevolent spirits, and thus, are highly revered. To ensure the favour of the Spirits and blessed fortune, the unwavering support of the Noaidi is essential."
 smi_protect_the_sacred_lands_title: "Protect the Sacred Lands"
 smi_protect_the_sacred_lands_desc: "While the territories under our control are  a pious land, the lack of temples dedicated to our Gods presents a great concern to our Shamans. To avoid the wrath of our Lords from manifesting into disaster for our people and tribe, we must initiate the construction of temples across our realm."
 smi_shrine_of_ukko_title: "The Shrine of Ukko"
 smi_shrine_of_ukko_desc: "Our skies, once blue and lively have been covered entirely by grey clouds. Ferocious and untimely thunderstorms strike across our realm, which the shamans interpret as the wrath of Ukko, the mighty God of Thunder. The Ylijumala can no longer be satisfied with the offering of the sacred Vakka. Perhaps erecting a Great Temple dedicated to his worship, sanctified under the shroud of the holy Rowan, will quell his anger and allow us to atone for our transgressions."
 smi_reform_the_faith_title: "Reform the Faith"
 smi_reform_the_faith_desc: "In its present state, our faith is one in name only, as the many regional and cultural differences among it's followers has left any hope of a unified doctrine dashed. By formalizing a defined clerical and theological structure to our faith, we can ensure that it persists through the test of time."
 smi_tame_the_reindeer_title: "Tame the Reindeer"
 smi_tame_the_reindeer_desc: "To the Sami people, the spiritual significance of the Reindeer extends beyond the continuation of livelihood. Seen as the provider of warmth and the link of humans to nature, our subjects have fostered a deep connection with the animal. As Reindeer husbandry continues to grow as a profession, we must ensure that the Chief focuses on developing the regions where the trade can prosper."
 smi_the_reindeer_cavalry_title: "The Reindeer Cavalry"
 smi_the_reindeer_cavalry_desc: "As tactics and weaponry evolve across Europe, many military thinkers within our nation have proposed a novel idea: utilizing the Reindeer as a mount for our cavalry officers. By selective breeding and nomadic practices, we may obtain variations of the Finnish forest reindeers capable of hauling large weights, and thus aid us in our wars. Our enemies shall tremble upon hearing the gallop of these majestic, furred beasts!"
 smi_warriors_of_sapmi_title: "Warriors of Sápmi"
 smi_warriors_of_sapmi_desc: "The Sami possess a proud tradition, a tradition of resistance against those who have tried to force us into servitude. Yet, our Chiefdom now faces existential danger from the heathens who surround us, who seek to destroy our faith, and the Finns to the South, who are eager to end our sovereignty. All those who consider these forests their home, shall join our ranks and defend this land until Olmai calls upon their soul."
 smi_finns_title: "Unite with the Finns"
 smi_finns_desc: "Beyond the mighty Kemijoki River lies the Kingdom of the Finns, a land of rigid order and governance. While they pride themselves on their structure, our people have been tempered by struggle, our armies forged into seasoned warriors. With the tide of history on our side, the time has come to bring the Finns under our banner, not as equals, but as subjects of a greater destiny."
 smi_liberate_karelia_title: "Liberate Karelia"
 smi_liberate_karelia_desc: "Our brethren in Karelia live under the brutal occupation of the Novgorodians. Any Sami who does not bow before their false Lord is put through excruciating torture, to break the mind and body, and eventually, the faith. Let us mount an expedition and cross the Kola Peninsula, and put an end to the malevolent rule of the Veche over the Karelians once and for all."
 smi_stronghold_of_christianity_title: "Stronghold of Christianity"
 smi_stronghold_of_christianity_desc: "For generations, Sweden has cast its shadow over our lands, marching under the banner of the Papacy to break our spirit and erase our faith. They burn our villages, silence our shamans, and call it salvation. But their zeal will shatter beneath the fury of the north. We shall rise, cast them from our lands, and show them that the soul of Sapmi bows to no cross."
 smi_strike_against_the_norse_title: "Strike Against the Norse"
 smi_strike_against_the_norse_desc: "For too long, the Norse have encroached upon our lands, raiding our villages and defiling our sacred sites. Their dominance across the northern seas has made them bold, but their arrogance will be their undoing. It is time to rally our warriors, sharpen our blades, and strike back against their tyranny. By reclaiming what is ours, we shall remind the Norse that the heart of the Sami people is unyielding, and we shall not bend before their tyranny."
 smi_dismantle_norway_title: "Dismantle Norway"
 smi_dismantle_norway_desc: "As the Jarldom of Norway stands on it's final knees, her craven and weary soldiers have begun preparing a feeble defense of their remaining holdings in Scandinavia. In their weakened state, a well-planned offensive may be enough to shatter their morale and declare victory. By the will of Ukko, our warriors shall rain thunder upon the heretics and put an end to the Viking farce."
 smi_into_the_baltics_title: "Into the Baltics"
 smi_into_the_baltics_desc: "The great city of Tallinn finds itself under the rule of the Paijkull. While our tribes share much in common, from faith to governance, it is clear that their wretched family has brought only misery to the people of Estonia. To realize the oneness of all those who follow the way of the Ylijumala, and to reap the profits from the ever-expanding Baltic trade, bringing the region into our fold is necessary."
 smi_pacify_novgorod_title: "Pacify Novgorod"
 smi_pacify_novgorod_desc: "With the loss of Karelia, Novgorod has suffered defeat after defeat—not only at our hands but also against rival kingdoms. Once, their armies outnumbered and outmatched ours, but now the final remnants of Russian resistance crumble beneath our advance. Their vast treasury lies within reach, ripe for the taking. By seizing Novgorod, we will secure not just wealth, but also a rightful claim to subjugate the fractured princedoms of the Rus."
 smi_ascendant_kalevalia_title: "Ascendant Kalevalia"
 smi_ascendant_kalevalia_desc: "As our tribe grows, so do its ambitions. From humble beginnings in the forests of Sapmi, we have conquered and united the Finns and Estonians under our banner. Our enemies' crowns and thrones crumble beneath the weight of our warriors, as the strength of the old ways overtakes the rigid rule of monarchs. The rise of Kalevalia marks not just the union of lands, but the return of tribal might over fragile kingdoms."
 smi_devastate_the_rus_title: "Devastate the Rus'"
 smi_devastate_the_rus_desc: "The Russian princedoms stand on their last legs! Centuries of oppression under the iron grip of their boyars shall be repaid in kind. Our campaign shall not be one of conquest, but rather one of punishment, for our Gods shall lend us their strength to hail devastation upon their cities. The Volga shall be our newest domain and the  people of the Rus' shall be eternally cursed to suffer the same hell they once imposed upon us!"
 smi_fury_of_the_north_title: "Fury of the North"
 smi_fury_of_the_north_desc: "Our tribe, once considered by the so-called great powers of Europe to be a ragtag group of scavengers and hunters now stands at the cusp of complete hegemony over the Norther lands. From Viipuri to Schleswig, we have brought unification upon this fractured land, and now we shall look outwards. Our enemies see us as nothing more than raiders, but we shall prove them wrong. We are the Spirit of the North, the vessels of fury which can only be possessed by people whose greatest foe is no man, but nature itself."
 smi_the_winds_of_winter_title: "The Winds of Winter"
 smi_the_winds_of_winter_desc: "Winter is a cruel and unyielding force, sweeping across the land with merciless fury, leaving nothing but frostbitten ruins and silence in its wake. Just as the cold spares none, neither shall we. With the howling blizzards at our backs and the will of our Gods guiding us, we shall march forth, conquering at the scale not seen since Alexander. The people of these lands have a choice - to submit or be blasted away by the inevitable hailstorm."
 smi_the_viking_dawn_title: "The Viking Dawn"
 smi_the_viking_dawn_desc: "The Vikings, unpredictable and erratic have provoked the wrath of our Chief by extending their raids onto our territory. No goodwill can exist between our honest people and these heathens, who are driven by the lust of blood and gold. Let us bring about an end to their domination over Scandinavia, and usher in a new era for the region free from the clutches of the Norsemen."
 smi_the_baltic_union_title: "The Baltic Union"
 smi_the_baltic_union_desc: "While the tribes of the Baltic continue to bicker among themselves, the Christians have seized the opportunity and embarked on a crusade against our brethren and continue to convert them at the tip of the sword. To prevent any further interference by the Papists, we must declare a dominion over the Baltic, a union to ensure that our common interests are safeguarded. Together, we shall defend our ancestral lands, preserve our traditions, and establish a lasting hegemony to ward off foreign invaders and their zealous ambitions."
 smi_sapmi_revival_title: "Revival of the Sámi"
 smi_sapmi_revival_desc: "Once a proud and thriving people, the Sámi have been driven to the forests of Lapponia, living in the shadow of Swedish Crusaders and Russian raiders. Yet our spirit endures, and it is time to rise above the fear and subjugation of centuries past. We must reclaim our ancestral lands from foreign occupiers, revive our sacred traditions, and ensure that our people’s identity and heritage remain unbroken. Let us secure a future where Sápmi belongs to the Sámi once more."
 smi_forest_title: "Tame the Boreal Forests"
 smi_forest_desc: "For centuries, the dense boreal forests of the North have been the lifeblood of the Sámi people. Every aspect of our society—our economy, traditions, and governance—has been shaped by these untamed woodlands. Now, as our realm grows in strength, we must harness their full potential, transforming them from mere sustenance into the foundation of a thriving, enduring nation."
 smi_fur_title: "Expand the Fur Trade"
 smi_fur_desc: "The fur trade is the lifeblood of our economy, employing countless hunters, skinners, and merchants across our lands. As the European beaver faces a huge decline in population, the demand for Reindeer fur has surged drastically, presenting us with a unique oppourtunity. By investing in trade infrastructure and expanding our networks, we can cement our dominance over this lucrative market, ensuring that our coffers overflow with gold for generations to come."
 smi_white_sea_title: "Control the White Sea"
 smi_white_sea_desc: "The Russian settlers, or the Pomors have transformed the desolate forests surrounding the White Sea into great trade ports, establishing a lucrative exchange network with Scandinavian and English merchants. Now, with our dominance over the fur trade firmly established, we stand poised to seize the full wealth of these waters. By securing the harbors and regulating commerce, we shall ensure that the White Sea becomes the beating heart of our growing northern empire."
 smi_preserve_our_heritage_title: "Preserve Our Heritage"
 smi_preserve_our_heritage_desc: "Sámi folklore, a testament to our virtues and piety, has been passed down orally for generations. Yet, without action, our roots risk fading into obscurity. Inspired by the Renaissance sweeping Europe, we must document our legends and wisdom, ensuring the survival of our culture for future generations."
 smi_enlightenment_title: "The Sámi Enlightenment"
 smi_enlightenment_desc: "Our Chief is neither a tyrant nor a lord, but rather a guardian of the Sami peoples, under whose benevolent rule our tribe has experienced unparalleled prosperity. Embracing the ideas of Enlightenment spread across Europe, our Chief now seeks to elevate our institutions, both economic and governmental, on par with the so-called 'civilised' monarchies of the West. Soon, great universities shall rise across our lands, transforming our realm from one governed by anarchy to one run by code and honor."

While it lasts, other "pagans" like ourselves, or even the Christian petty kingdoms surroundings us may be interested in a friendship of convenience.

 est_pacify_novgorod_desc: "The Novgorodian merchants are warmongerers, and though we have defeated them in Karelia and Neva, we are fully aware that they would never rest until our country was destroyed, utterly replaced by their banner, faith, and people.

 est_claim_lithuania_desc: "The Hercogyste of Lithuania stands as a dangerous threat to our sovereignty. In these fractured lands, their destiny can easily be one of domination.

 est_renovate_tallinn_desc: "While never a historically large city, with some patronage, our capital Tallinn has much potential.

 est_industrial_expansion_title: "Industrial Expansion"
 est_industrial_expansion_desc: "While we may lack a large population or warm fertile soil, we Estonian make up for it with our propensity for hard work.
