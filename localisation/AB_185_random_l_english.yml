 #Seljuk Event
 ab_seljuk.16.t:0 "New Head of Ummah"
 ab_seljuk.16.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has claimed the sword and mantle of Muhammad. Not only is this a great position for our Sultan domestically, but it additionally affords him authority over all Muslims outside our borders, giving us greater opportunity to protect those unlucky enough to be ruled over by non-Muslims. The question remains though what religious and spiritual path our Caliphate shall take. The ways of Legalism and Sufism are both present in our government, yet only one of them can be pursued on a governmental level."
 ab_seljuk.16.a:0 "We must embrace and protect the laws of the Islam."
 ab_seljuk.16.b:0 "Only through mysticism can we find Allah's mercy."
 #Zunist Flavor
 ab_zunist.1.t:0 "Solar Eclipse"
 ab_zunist.1.d:0 "The heavens above our glorious capital were illuminated by a radiant light as Zun cast his divine gaze upon our land. But alas, as swiftly as his brilliance graced us, darkness swept across the realm. This moment lasted mere minutes, yet its impact has kindled panic that threatens to engulf us for months, perhaps even years to come.\n\nSome perceive the event as a sacred sign from Zun himself, yet its significance is hotly debated among the faithful. Has our God abandoned in our people? Some even whisper behind closed doors that our ruler has committed an unforgivable sin.\n\nAs the populace grapples with this sign from the heavens, chaos has gripped our nation, its tendrils reaching every corner of our land. Fear and unrest have taken root, disrupting the tranquillity that once reigned over our prosperous realm."
 ab_zunist.1.a:0 "Stop looking at the sky!"

 ab_zunist.2.t:0 "Festival of the Sun"
 ab_zunist.2.d:0 "Across the land festivals are being held in the honour of the Justice Bringer, Zun. Faithful gather from near and far to partake in this grand celebration in the honour of the Sun God, creating an atmosphere of jubilation and reverence. Naturally, we may decide to promote the festivities, appeasing both the people and high priesthood, should we desire."
 ab_zunist.2.a:0 "Let us not be frugal, blessed be the Sun God!"
 ab_zunist.2.b:0 "We can spare some funds"
 ab_zunist.2.c:0 "This is none of our concern"
 zunist_scorching:0 "Scorching Sun"
 ab_zunist.3.t:0 "The Scorching Sun"
 ab_zunist.3.d:0 "Our enemies, who dare to invade our lands, find themselves subjected to the harsh and scorching rays and merciless wrath of Zun. The invaders suffer in their every breathing moment, many dying to heat, exhaustion or dehydration. This clear display of divine retribution casts a warning to those who would dare challenge us and strengthens the faith of our people in the war."
 ab_zunist.3.a:0 "Zun’s justice is as mighty as his wrath"
 warriors_of_zun:0 "Warriors of the Sun"
 ab_zunist.4.t:0 "Warriors of the Sun"
 ab_zunist.4.d:0 "Among the most zealous ranks of Zun's faithful, a warrior society emerges, known as 'The Warriors of The Sun', they embody the virtues of bravery, justice, and unwavering faith in the radiant light of Zun. Renowned for their ferocity when faces the forces of darkness, these ironlike men stand ready to lend their strength should our realm be in conflict with the infidel."
 ab_zunist.4.a:0 "Blessed be Zun and his warriors!"
 ab_zunist.5.t:0 "Zun's Trials"
 ab_zunist.5.d:0 "Various traditions and beliefs, testing one’s endurance and faith to Zun have been passed down for centuries amongst the many Zunist communities within our nation and across the world. Among them are Zun’s trials, which include living in an inhospitable environment (often a desert) for three days and three nights. Those who survive the test are surely blessed by Zun himself. Recently, our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] has taken an interest in undertaking these trials, no matter the risk to his life."
 ab_zunist.5.a:0 "Let him prove his faith!"
 ab_zunist.5.b:0 "Stop this madness!"
