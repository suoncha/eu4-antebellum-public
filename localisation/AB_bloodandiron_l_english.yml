 lom_golden_age_title:0 "L'eta d'Oro"
 lom_golden_age_desc:0 "Times of great change and rebirth are coming to Italy; if we can foster this growth and take the reins of history, perhaps we could become cultural hegemons of the peninsula altogether. Greatness awaits us!"
 lom_secure_piedmont_title:0 "Secure Piedmont"
 lom_secure_piedmont_desc:0 "The young counts of Savoie have defied us for too long. With their brittle politics and ambitious goals, they threaten the entire peninsula as well; we must secure the Alps and place them in our responsible hands."
 lom_defeat_genoa_title:0 "Defeat Genoa"
 lom_defeat_genoa_desc:0 "The Republic of Genoa to our south prevents us access to the sea and hinders the possibilities of our kingdom. By conquering it, we'll have free range over the Tyrrenic sea."
 lom_reclaim_po_title:0 "Reclaim the Po Valley"
 lom_reclaim_po_desc:0 "The Po Valley, where the longest river in the peninsula sits placidly, is under the administration of weak-minded buffoons with far-fetched claims of greatness, when it could very well serve its immortal purpose as the granary of our Kingdom.."
 lom_regno_title:0 "Regno d'Italia"
 lom_regno_desc:0 "No longer kings of Lombardy, but of Italy! Once nobody is left on the peninsula to oppose us, nothing will prevent us from proclaiming ourselves as its ultimate sovereigns."
 lom_emilia_romagna_title:0 "Rein in Romagna"
 lom_emilia_romagna_desc:0 "Since Byzantine times, the Po estuary and Ravenna have been just out of our reach. They represent everything we fight against, and their destruction will solidify our victory over all foreign invaders."
 lom_tuscany_title:0 "Conquer Tuscany"
 lom_tuscany_desc:0 "The plains of Tuscany are home to some of the most prosperous cities in Italy, rivaling Pavia in glory, history and riches. By the grace of God, we shall strike and place those beautiful jewels under our benevolent administration."
 lom_end_venice_title:0 "End the Serenissima"
 lom_end_venice_desc:0 "The Serene Republic of Venice, our oldest rival, now stands alone between us and complete control of the north. Their pitiful attempts to curb our strength have failed, and the cities of Veneto shall bend the knee to us."
 lom_claim_tirol_title:0 "Claim Tirol"
 lom_claim_tirol_desc:0 "The mountains to our north leave us exposed to assaults from Germany, thus it is imperative we strike first and for once return the favour."
 lom_adriatic_littoral_title:0 "The Adriatic Littoral"
 lom_adriatic_littoral_desc:0 "Leaving the Adriatic sea unconquered and unprotected is a strategic liability; we should hit them while we can, secure it and have our natural defenses finally completed."
 lom_italian_dalmatia_title:0 "Italian Dalmatia"
 lom_italian_dalmatia_desc:0 "Our predecessors knew the value of Dalmatia as an additional line of defense and offense against the east; many Italians living there are constantly at risk of being expelled from their homes, and this shall not stand. Let slip the dogs of war!"
 lom_imperatore_title:0 "Imperatore dei Romani"
 lom_imperatore_desc:0 "We shan't let the petty Germans, Greeks or Franks kid themselves no longer. It's clear to the world that our state is the only natural continuation of the Roman Empire, and we shall ensure it will last forever."
 lom_imperial_ambition_title:0 "Secure the Electors"
 lom_imperial_ambition_desc:0 "Past the Alps, rich and powerful men with the imperial dignity, like us, would certainly support us - for a price - in our endeavour to secure the next election."
 lom_arelat_intervention_title:0 "Arelat Intervention"
 lom_arelat_intervention_desc:0 "The kingdom of Burgundy lays divided between petty lords, while the rich province of Arles remains fraught by war and devastated by pillaging. Perhaps it is our chance to show these fools who the real kings of Burgundy are: us!"
 lom_transalpine_title:0 "Transalpine Possessions"
 lom_transalpine_desc:0 "We deem it fundamental to cripple the Franks, our old adversaries, in their moment of weakness. Their fortresses will crumble again and again under our blows, and soon their entire nation will be just another province of our growing Empire."
 lom_roman_resolution_title:0 "Roman Resolution"
 lom_roman_resolution_desc:0 "The Italian nation and the Papacy are in an awkward position. Through tradition and history, the Papacy claims the right to rule large swathes of Central Italy. Through people and geography, Italy claims the right to rule all of the Italian peninsula. Tensions will remain between the two institutions, unless a more permanent agreement can be reached."
 lom_call_crusade_title:0 "Call of the Crusade"
 lom_call_crusade_desc:0 "Christendom is under threat. In both Sicily and Iberia, the Saracens lay siege to our way of life. It is time for us to answer the call of the crusade, to bring forth the judgement of God on these heathens."
 lom_liberate_south_title:0 "Liberate the Mezzogiorno"
 lom_liberate_south_desc:0 "The Mezzogiorno, southern Italy, has been placed under the occupation of enemies of our faith. Their presence so close to the Catholic home lands in the province of Italia is outrageous. It is up to us, the Lombards, to liberate this region to bring it back to the Catholic church."
 lom_shadow_kingdom_title:0 "The Shadow Kingdom"
 lom_shadow_kingdom_desc:0 "The Holy Roman Empire, despite having the word Roman in its name, was from the very start a Germanic empire. Over the centuries numerous emperors attempted to impose their rule over Italy. However, as the empire decentralised, its authority began to weaken. The imperial Kingdom of Italy slowly became a shadow kingdom. Now is the time to detach ourselves from the empire."
 lom_reform_government_title:0 "Reform the Government"
 lom_reform_government_desc:0 "Our government contains a vast host of influences, from the leftover administration of the Goths and the Romans as well as Lombard-introduced customs. Overtime it became overextended, and it is in need of reform should the Kingdom of the Lombards survive into the modern era."
 lom_lombard_absolutism_title:0 "Lombard Absolutism"
 lom_lombard_absolutism_desc:0 "As the feudal age withered away it became apparent that states must be centralised in order to be successful. We should look towards the major European absolutist states and learn from their ways of government. An absolutist Lombardy is a successful Lombardy."
 lom_proclaim_an_empire_title:0 "Proclaim an Empire"
 lom_proclaim_an_empire_desc:0 "The Lombardic kingdom never managed to claim the imperial title for itself, for our ancestors were subjugated by a rival Germanic realm, the Franks. However, now that we are strong and independent again, it is time for us to proclaim an empire for ourselves, one that would make our ancestors proud."
 lom_gates_title:0 "The Adriatic Gates"
 lom_gates_desc:0 "The Adriatic Gates are of the utmost importance to our kingdom. Situated at the crossroads between Germany, Italy, and the Balkans, this region must be controlled by us so that we may ensure Lombardy is safe."
 lom_liberate_isles_title:0 "Liberate the Isles"
 lom_liberate_isles_desc:0 "We must fully drive out those that are hostile to our faith from the isles. Their occupation of the people here must be stopped. This humiliation to our royal authority shall be finally put to an end."
 lom_mare_nostrum_title:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 lom_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "Just as the Romans were the masters of the Mediterranean sea, we too shall lay claim to Mare Nostrum, our ocean, by becoming the undisputed master of the region in trade, culture, and military."
 lom_lombard_renaissance_title:0 "Lombard Renaissance"
 lom_lombard_renaissance_desc:0 "Our position in the middle of many cultures and ideas mixed with our duke's recent sponsorship of learned men has led to a rebirth of ancient ideas on all aspects of life. It is time for Pavia to lead Europe out of its dark age."
 lom_hospital_title:0 "Ospedale Ca Granda"
 lom_hospital_desc:0 "As we have seen with the frequent plagues that come to Europe, particularly the Black Death, a modern state needs modern medicine, to this end we shall open up a new and grand public hospital, for the benefit of all. The fact that this will keep our citizens loyal to us has certainly not played a factor in this decision at all."
 lom_architectural_title:0 "Architectural Renovation"
 lom_architectural_desc:0 "We already hold one of the wealthiest provinces in Europe, and now the time has come to make it look as such. By applying the foremost architectural practices in Europe we can make a new Rome."
 lom_regia_marina_title:0 "Regia Marina"
 lom_regia_marina_desc:0 "For centuries we have fallen prey to the vile pirates along our coasts, but this will happen no longer. The time has come to create a grand armada aimed to defend our great nation and allow us to take our rightful place in the heart of the Mediterranean."
 lom_militarism_title:0 "Lombard Militarism"
 lom_militarism_desc:0 "Times are changing, and our old feudal ways of fighting will no longer help us. Let us call upon both our Roman and Germanic roots to harken forth a new area of strict discipline and ferocious combat prowess, the days of Lombard supremacy are about to start."
 lom_alpine_title:0 "Alpine Fortifications"
 lom_alpine_desc:0 "Our Alpine border must be secure unless we want to repeat the Frankish domination of old. Let Italy stay strong in the face of Germanic barbarism."
 lom_production_title:0 "Industrialise the Production"
 lom_production_desc:0 "While our wealth is unparalleled now, new practices in production and economics could undermine this dominance. We should look to introduce these new methods into our lands quickly before we get swept aside."
 lom_urbanize_title:0 "Urbanize Italy"
 lom_urbanize_desc:0 "Right now our population mostly toils away in the countryside, but if we are to keep moving forward in adopting modern economics, we must look to urbanise."
 lom_powerhouse_title:0 "Industrial Powerhouse"
 lom_powerhouse_desc:0 "Our adoption of modern economics and production practices have made us strong, but true industrialization is within our grasp. Soon our economic dominance will be assured for centuries to come!"
 lom_trade_title:0 "Trade Hegemony"
 lom_trade_desc:0 "While the wealth of Italian trade has changed much in the years since the discovery of the new world, we still retain some of that former glory. Let us implement more modern commercial practices and restore Italy's place in the centre of the Mediterranean."
 #Genoa
 gen_dominante_title:0 "La Dominante dei Mari"
 gen_dominante_desc:0 "Rule over the Mediterranean has always been synonymous with a strong and capable navy. Without one, we are open to naval blockades from our epicurean rival Venice to the east, and pirate raids from the belligerent Andalusians and Sicilians. We must  build a navy unrivalled; if we wish to remain dominant in the seas."
 gen_baleares_title:0 "Seize the Baleares"
 gen_baleares_desc:0 "The Baleares have been contested islands since the Medieval era. Their proximity to the Iberian mainland and their numerous excellent harbours have supported countless offensive operations against foreign threats to whoever holds control over the Balearic Islands. Taking control of them for ourselves will grant us strategic flexibility in the future."
 gen_landfall_title:0 "Landfall in Iberia"
 gen_landfall_desc:0 "To expand our trade empire, local trade hubs across the entire Mediterranean will need to be brought under our control. In particular, the ports in Valencia and Barcelona are particularly valuable for their textile production. The lavish Christian monarchies will pay almost any price for silk and cloth of such high quality."
 gen_sicily_title:0 "Fall of Sicily"
 gen_sicily_desc:0 "The crushing of our forces in the coalition against Sicily at Amalfi was an ignominy, written off and explained as a Sicilian military success. We know better - it was an ignominy of the Italian states and their inability to unite for a common cause. As such, we shall do it ourselves! Let us expel the Sicilians from their heartland and wash away the disgrace of last century!"
 gen_cagliari_title:0 "Reclaim Cagliari"
 gen_cagliari_desc:0 "Sicilian control over the south of Sardinia in Cagliari prevents any peace on the island, with local groups commonly engaging in armed conflict. Uniting Sardinia under one banner will allow both us and the Sardinian locals to move on towards more... profitable ventures."
 gen_combat_title:0 "Combating Piracy"
 gen_combat_desc:0 "The Western Mediterranean is rife with pirates, privateers and slave raiders. The Maghrebi scourge, with their miserable economic policies, seeks to pilfer from others and ransom for hostages rather than develop their desolate towns! For the greater good, we must root out this piracy from every corner and crevice of the Mediterranean!"
 gen_end_title:0 "End the Berber Raids"
 gen_end_desc:0 "With our amassed and superior fleet controlling the majority of the trade along the boot of Italy and the Tunisian and Catalonian coastlines, vigilant eyes watching every corner and crevice hidden in the shadows, the Berber raiders are no longer able to threaten the prosperity of our trade lanes."
 gen_blockade_title:0 "Break the Blockade"
 gen_blockade_desc:0 "Since the fall of the Visigoths in 711 to al-Andalus, the Gibraltar strait has remained under blockade in cooperation with the Moroccan Sultanate, forbidding any Christian ships from crossing without paying an extortionate price. Combined with unsuccessful negotiations with their rival Nizzarid sultanate in the east to gain access to the Red Sea, it turns to military intervention if we wish to sail into deeper, unknown waters..."
 gen_gibraltar_title:0 "Control Gibraltar"
 gen_gibraltar_desc:0 "Gibraltar and its twin across the strait, Ceuta, are two of the most defensible provinces in the entirety of Europe and Africa. Surrounded by rugged highlands in all directions and open only to the sea, suffering heavy attrition is guaranteed for any campaigning armies who wish to march upon the fortified towns - a perfect match for Genoese naval capabilities and our interests in Iberia and the beyond."
 gen_canaries_title:0 "Settle the Canaries"
 gen_canaries_desc:0 "Legends speak of entire uninhabited continents across the open ocean, free to take for anyone willing to make the perilous journey into the unknown. If we wish to embark on this endeavour, we must first establish a purpose-built location on the Canaries to support our exploration."
 gen_new_world_title:0 "Discover the New World"
 gen_new_world_desc:0 "The whispers of lands across the oceans have attracted many adventurous figures, requisitioning deep-keeled ships to sail out into the west where these lands lie. A man of our own going by the name of Cristoforo Colombo, a self-made man who has built a small reputation journeying to the far reaches of the known world. He has proposed a series of voyages past the Canaries, only to stop once they hit land as far as the eye can see. With our plentiful navy, we can spare some for his ambitions..."
 gen_caribbean_title:0 "A Caribbean Colony"
 gen_caribbean_desc:0 "While the newly named Caribbean is not the endless continent that was promised, its central location to the entire region ensures it as the dominant trade location, an ideal match for the Genoese merchant flotilla."
 gen_pirates_title:0 "No Pirates in My Caribbean"
 gen_pirates_desc:0 "The Genoese people had a dream. A dream, of a land far away from worldly responsibility... a land where the sun never sets, where the ocean goes as far as the eye can see. An ocean unpolluted by cannon fire and the blood of men, undisturbed by pirates and the screams of their victims. This dream is no longer just that, but a true and immediate reality. As long as the Genoese remain, this dream shall stand, and there shall be no pirates in our Caribbean!"
 gen_panama_title:0 "Control Panama"
 gen_panama_desc:0 "The final piece of our control over the American trade lanes lies in the control over the Panama strip. As the only land crossing between the North and South, the brave and bold who wish to make handsome profits will always need to venture across this place, and those who value their lives more will need our assistance to cross."
 gen_north_title:0 "Rein in the North"
 gen_north_desc:0 "Our current holdings in Italy are a major defensive liability, with simply no lands to project authority over north Italy. If we want to attract traders from across Europe, taking key trade corridors in Lombard and Savoyard hands will have to be the priority of our military policy."
 gen_coastline_title:0 "Control Ligurian Coast"
 gen_coastline_desc:0 "Our Ligurian heartland will need to be consolidated before we can expand any further - peace at home must first be achieved before we set for distant lands."
 gen_venice_title:0 "Dismantle the Arch-Enemy"
 gen_venice_desc:0 "The menace in Venice has been our eternal arch-enemy, competing tooth and nail with us for every ducat at trade hubs and for every port across the Mediterranean. It is no secret that they have had the upper hand at every turn - until now. The Venetians maintain a defensive guarantee over the Crusader states and the Holy Land itself, singularly funding the Crusader expeditions after our expulsion from the Levant at their hands. With their attention stretched so thin and far from home, it is an opportune time to sail into the Venetian canals uncontested. If they wish to control the Levant so much, they can live in exile there!"
 gen_adriatic_title:0 "Adriatic Consolidation"
 gen_adriatic_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of Venice has given us a marginal foothold on the eastern side of the Italian coast. Monopoly over trade in Italy requires expanding our holdings in the Adriatic to also include the Croatian lowlands."
 gen_arsenal_title:0 "Seize the Arsenal"
 gen_arsenal_desc:0 "The Venetian Arsenal is one of the most feared locations in the entirety of Europe. An industrial complex the size of a small town, it was used by the Venetians to build ships entirely from scratch within days - loaded with all required munitions. Not only that, it is also a nigh impenetrable fort, surrounded with ramparts to supplement the heavily guarded Venetian waterways. Seizing the Arsenal for ourselves and requisitioning the labourers to our benefit will intimidate all our foes."
 gen_tuscany_title:0 "Consolidate Tuscany"
 gen_tuscany_desc:0 "Tuscany is by far the most developed region of Italy, serving as the economic capital of the world and the heart of trade in Italy and Europe at large. Admittedly, De Medici's rule has brought perpetual prosperity to Tuscan lands. However, with the passing of the renowned and respected Cosimo, all who have Italian ambitions eye Tuscany as bountiful lands without a sufficient army nor strategic depth to protect them."
 gen_liberate_south_title:0 "Liberate the Mezzogiorno"
 gen_liberate_south_desc:0 "After our glorious conquest of Sicily proper, the remaining holdings of the Sultanate in Italy are clamouring for our aid in their liberation. Wipe out the last vestige of Abu Zakariya Yahya's legacy in Europe!"
 gen_romagna_title:0 "Subjugate Romagna"
 gen_romagna_desc:0 "As our strength grows without opposition in North Italy, there are few Italian princes left in the Holy Roman Empire to oppose us. The seeds of a united Italy will bear fruit in the oncoming spring, and the rise of the Repubblica Italiana will be inevitable!"
 gen_republic_title:0 "Repubblica Italiana"
 gen_republic_desc:0 "Old enemies have been conquered, and every Italian prince has been unseated. Past humiliations have been redeemed, and the Peninsula is united, prospering together under a single republic. We have achieved a feat that only one other state has achieved before... Let us proclaim the Repubblica Italiana!"
 gen_mexico_title:0 "Mexican Bases"
 gen_mexico_desc:0 "Sailing west past the newly discovered Carribean islands, Cristoforo was finally beached upon the tropical sands of an exciting, mysterious landmass. The company of adventurers accompanying him ventured into the tropical rainforests, only to come across stone monoliths of wonder, more amazing than the Colosseum of Roma or the Pyramids of Giza. Towering above them, as if reaching for the sky. The Catholic Church in Rome has affirmed our claim over the entire region; what magical things will this place hide? "
 gen_aztec_gold_title:0 "Aztec Gold"
 gen_aztec_gold_desc:0 "Continuing the legacy of Cristoforo Corombo, a new wave of conquistadors funded by the royal treasury have ventured out into the New World and have finally found success! They have discovered valleys of gold hidden in the jungle groves of the Mexican hills, guarded by the primitive native tribes. While the gold in Europe depletes from unyielding overuse, the treasure fleets our colonial governors will be able to send back to the homeland will ensure a wealth untold of, quite possibly even surpassing the legendary Mansa of the deep Saharan deserts of Mali."
 gen_reform_colonial_admin_title:0 "Colonial Administration"
 gen_reform_colonial_admin_desc:0 "The New World is and extremely distant place from our homeland. It takes months for even the most urgent of news to travel from one end to another, and as such it means we will need to be able to trust the colonial administrators to do their job and be able to control the situation. We will need to reform the administration and introduce safeguards to ensure this."
 gen_explore_the_jungle_title:0 "Rumble in the Jungle"
 gen_explore_the_jungle_desc:0 "The lands of South America are a brand new world for our exploration teams, with the hot and humid jungle climate an almost insurmountable challenge to overcome. The addition of hostile wildlife putting them on edge has made colonisation efforts extremely slow. We will need to ensure the other European powers never reach the shorts of our colonial outposts, or they will bear the fruits of our arduous effots."
 gen_river_of_silver_title:0 "The River of Silver"
 gen_river_of_silver_desc:0 "Upon the sunblessed plains of the South American continent flow the crystal clear waters, forming rivers of silver. Where land meets sky and the sun never sets, the open land presents incredible opportunities for adventure and expansion."
 gen_southern_domination_title:0 "Dominate the South" #America
 gen_southern_domination_desc:0 "Though the North American continent beholds a plethora of new cultures and customs that are foreign to us, there is only one pre-eminent power in South America - then Incan empire. In control of the largest collective deposits in the known world, the Andes mountain range ensure their empire has flourished without hindrance. If we wish to dominate the south, it is imperative that they be eliminated!"
 gen_bases_in_africa_title:0 "Bases in Africa"
 gen_bases_in_africa_desc:0 "All throughout storied European history, never has Christian control reached into the savannahs and jungles of sub-Saharan Africa. Though routes through the Sahara desert into the Sahel have long been used by the Maghrebi Arab traders, rising powers within the region threaten our prospering Mediterranean trade. Perhaps, there is another route - naval routes to outposts into the Sahel."
 gen_venture_inland_title:0 "Venture Inland"
 gen_venture_inland_desc:0 "With several key West African bases secured, there is little hindering us from traversing east into the wondrous AFrican savanna. One feels simply idyllic when seeing these lands for the first time; we must have it! The opportunities here are so vast, why did we ever bother with competing with the vindictive Venetians in the Levant?"
 gen_tomatoes_title:0 "Import Tomatoes"
 gen_tomatoes_desc:0 "Some call it a poision apple, some call it deadly nightshade, but the locals call it xitomatl. From what little we know, it presents a useful, sour taste when crushed and processed into paste. With our completed conquest of the Mexican highlands, things are finally settling down and we can focus on more mundane matters. The introduction of 'xitomatl' to Europe, as fresh produce may take a long time, and as such we should develop the industry for these foods so we can take advantage later."
 gen_spice_isles_title:0 "Reach the Spice Isles"
 gen_spice_isles_desc:0 "Far beyond even the reaches of Arabic diaspora, we have finally sailed to the raindrop islands of the East Indies. Dotted with millions of islands large and small, it is a simple yet lengthy process to build a trade company. It will, however, be worth the investment, with access to the Arabic coffee and Asian spice supplies withheld from us. That's no matter, we'll make a far better profit with our spice fleets!"
 gen_sail_around_africa_title:0 "Sail Around Africa"
 gen_sail_around_africa_desc:0 "With the decline of the Silk Road amid rising regional tensions, and our emerging rivalry with the Venetians and the Nizzarid dictatorship in the traditional land routes through north Africa, the Levant and Persia, the pragmatic Genoese republic needs to find alternative routes to reach Asia. Let us set an outpost on the southern tip of Africa - with the renewed hope of reaching the old silk road entrepots, it shall be called the Cape of Good Hope!"
 gen_entrepot_of_india_title:0 "Entrepot of India"
 gen_entrepot_of_india_desc:0 "The Indus plains were known long to the Europeans, with the conquest of Alexander into the north and the Roman Empire's interaction with traders on the Silk Road. A gargantuan landmass of population comparable to the entirety of Europe, gaining even a single entrepot on the coasts of India will allow us to sap a share of the market that would measure equal to controlling an entire peninsula."

 gen_the_proud_city_title:0 "The Proud City of Genoa"
 gen_the_proud_city_desc:0 "Long outdone by other cities of Christendom, Genoa has now become the diamond of Italy. Supported by hard work and plentiful investment by the Doge, the city has become an incredible metropolis that our forefathers would be proud of."
 gen_dominate_the_markets_title:0 "Dominate the Markets"
 gen_dominate_the_markets_desc:0 "The founding of the Bank of Saint George has centralised the economic power of the Mediterranean into our hands. In combination with our mutually friendly stance with the Greek sovereigns, this has allowed us a mercantile advantage over the complacent Venetians and provided us with a dominance over the market of premium products. This hegemony will ensure prosperous trade for as long as the Genoan republic stands!"
 gen_la_superba_title:0 "La Superba"
 gen_la_superba_desc:0 "The city of Genoa stands proud at the knee of Italy, as the cornerstone of trade and the lifeblood of the Renaissance in Europe outside of Constantinople. The Republic has outgrown its traditional walls, and has spilled out into the ports, the hills and the countryside. Our wealth transcends Europe, and Genoan cultural influence has reached new highs! This splendorous age for Genoa shall withstand the tests of time!"
 gen_mare_nostrum_title:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 gen_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "The elimination of hostile forces in the Mediterranean has allowed us to safely expand our trade fleets, ensuring their global proliferation. Our fleets are like a tide, inexorably ebbing and flowing from coast to coast, only resting when the skies are not. This is Mare Nostrum."
 gen_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Secure the Naval Trade"
 gen_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "Our growing economy will need to be supported by a growing merchant fleet, in order to ensure the Republic is able to trade for goods and materials required for our markets and new infrastructure alike. Securing our naval lanes will be a high priority!"
 gen_genoese_renaissance_title:0 "Genoese Renaissance"
 gen_genoese_renaissance_desc:0 "Our exile from the eastern Mediterranean has been followed by the exodus of Byzantine scholars and Old Latin philosophers from Greece proper, aware of the imminent crisis arriving from all sides. As a result, many of our returning fleets carry additional passengers willing to offer their services and knowledge to the Genoan republic, in exchange for safe passage to our homelands. This may be a fortuitous twist of fate, and we would be foolish not to take advantage of this."
 gen_reform_the_republic_title:0 "Reform the Republic"
 gen_reform_the_republic_desc:0 "There are few sovereign states that will ever be able to withstand the tests of time without reforms to administration. The largest empires known to Europe collapsed under their own weight, even with significant effort to reform their governance. We must not fall to the same mistake, and learn from the errors of the past - our failures during the 14th century have demonstrated that we have much to do. Reforming the republic will be necessary to secure our future."
 
 ab_genoa.1.t:0 "Fall of Sicily"
 ab_genoa.1.d:0 "After many centuries we've finally been able to drive the Arabs away from Sicilia, in no small part thanks to the investment in our navy. The Christians still living on the island welcome us as liberators and urge us to continue fighting the Muslims, be it the ones residing in southern Italy or the ones in the Maghreb. Our successful conquest of Sicily has sent shockwaves through the Arab world who are now forced to accept that the Sultanate of Sicily, at one point comparable with Andalusia, is not only on the decline but close to becoming another relic of the past. Our italian brethren are now imagining, a world where Rome and the Papacy are safe from the Muslim threat, where the Christians of Mezzogiorno live under a christian state, a world where Italy has no Sultanates on it. For now these are just ambitions, but one thing has been made clear with our conquest."
 ab_genoa.1.a:0 "Sicily will never be a part of a Sultanate again."
 ab_genoa.2.t:0 "The Birth of Italy" #Republican Italy
 ab_genoa.2.d:0 "Our humble republic has expanded greatly. At first we had to be opportunistic, picking our battles carefully we were able to take Nice from the Savoyards, we were able to conquer the entirety of Tuscany, picking off the Republics there one by one. Next, we saw weakness to the north, pushing into Piedmont, Lombardy and the Po Valley. As our republic's territory grew, so did our might and the ambitions of the Doges. Ambitions of a unified Italian Republic. Emilia-Romagna and our archenemies in Venice were all that remained in our way to proclaiming the Republic and we handled both situations optimally. Emilia-Romagna's states were weak and whatever allies they mustered weren't able to oppose us. La Serenissima was completely overwhelmed, its navy and armies were unable to keep up with ours and when the city fell our Doge proclaimed that the Venetian Republic was dissolved, the role of Venetian Doge disbanded. With all these territories now in our possession, our republic no longer represents Genoa. It is now at long last a Republic that represents the Italians, not just the people of Genoa."
 ab_genoa.2.a:0 "Viva Italia. Viva la Repubblica Italiana!"
 ab_genoa.3.t:0 "The Dissolution of La Serenissima" #Dissolution of Venice
 ab_genoa.3.d:0 "Venice had been a thorn on our side since the founding of our Republic in the 11th Century, with both states fighting over trade and maritime influence across the mediterranean. Up until recently, this rivalry was decently balanced but our expansion gave us an upper hand on the Venetians. Enough of an upper hand for us to plan the conquest of Venice itself, it took many seasons but we planned our wars carefully and eventually managed to beat Venice back all the way back to the city of water itself, however, this was to be the end of the Serenissima. When the city fell and peace was declared, our Doge went to the Venetian Doge's palace, announcing the peace terms to the people and the soldiers standing in St. Mark's Square.  'The Serene Republic of Venice is, henceforth dissolved, with the city of Venice itself now coming under direct control of the Genoan Doge! Rejoice, for this is a new beginning for you all!' The soldiers and some of the people did whilst others were more cautious, unsure of what their future would be, in due time they'd come to understand. Our doge stayed the night in the Palace, celebrating his victory in his rival's seat of power."
 ab_genoa.3.a:0 "Our archrivals are gone at last."

 ab_lombardy.3.d:0 "Centuries after Charlemagne's conquest and the dissolution of the first Lombard kingdom, Italy had languished in a state of disarray, with various noble houses vying for dominance and the peninsula divided into numerous fiefdoms. The echoes of petty internal squabbles reverberated across the land, stifling progress and preventing Italy from uniting under a single banner. The Roman legacy, once a shining beacon of cultural and intellectual enlightenment, had dimmed amidst the chaos. Since then, no Italian noble managed to fully restore authority over the nation until now.\n\nThe rebirth of Italy is not merely a political feat; it is a cultural renaissance of unparalleled proportions. The very essence of Italian identity, infused with a profound appreciation for the Roman legacy, is rekindled. A symphony of artistic expression, intellectual curiosity, and architectural marvels emerges, painting a vibrant tableau that captivates the imagination of both the citizens and the world at large.\n\nWith the revival of our fortunes, the intricate tapestry of Italian culture once again finds itself interwoven with the intricate threads of its Roman ancestry. The land becomes a living testament to the resilience of a people who, against all odds, triumph over division and rekindle the flames of their shared heritage. This revitalized Italy stands as a testament to the potential dormant within a united nation, serving as an enduring reminder that the echoes of history can be harnessed to forge a future brimming with promise and distinction."

Now, with our shores finally secured, our eyes turn to the beautiful sea, where the sails of the routed Muslims can still be seen. Why should this be the end of our glorious campaign?"

 ab_lombardy.5.t:0 "The Empire of Italy"
 ab_lombardy.5.d:0 "In the early years, when the first Lombard kingdom was still powerful, many monarchs attempted to exploit the disagreements between the stilted Papacy and the decadent Byzantines to have themselves crowned emperors. But now, that the whole of the peninsula sits under our grasp, that the Pope is our subject and the Eastern Romans nowhere to be seen on our shores, the king and his entourage came to a simple realisation: nobody is stopping us anymore. Our king, now emperor, has been crowned this morning in Rome, and,albeit the Pope’s eyes betray a hint still of hidden discontent, he couldn’t do anything as the emperor lifted the Iron Crown from his hands and, facing the congregated nobles, placed it on his own head. In the cheers of the nobility and the roaring people outside Saint Peter’s basilica, some claim to have heard angelic trumpets, marking the beginning of a new Holy Roman Empire. Of course the Germans and Gauls on the other side of the Alps may disagree: but, be that as it may, it’s clear that to the people we are now Rome."

 ab_aquitaine.1.t:0 "A New Capital"
 ab_aquitaine.1.d:0 "Toulouse has long been the center of Aquitania, both economically and politically. Capital of our forebears the Visigoths, and by far the largest city in the region, many in our court are now questioning if we should shift our own capital from [Root.Capital.GetName] to Toulouse."
 ab_aquitaine.1.a:0 "A new Aquitania needs a new capital."
 ab_aquitaine.1.b:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] is already a splendid capital, let it be."
 ab_aquitaine.2.t:0 "Aquitanian Restoration"
 ab_aquitaine.2.d:0 "Although we have bent the knee to the Franks for centuries, the Aquitanians have never forgotten that we are our own people. Our own sophisticated laws and courts have influenced countless realms across Europe, and our armies and castles have blocked the advance of the Moors time and time again. With our new found dominance over our former overlords, it is time to restore the Visigothic kingdom of old, and proclaim a new Aquitaniania."
 ab_aquitaine.2.a:0 "Aquitania Aeterna!"
 #Missions
 aqt_reform_army_title:0 "Reform the Army"
 aqt_reform_army_desc:0 "Europe's vast landmass is dominated by burgeoning armies of an increasingly professional calibre. Drills are becoming the norm, with tightly regimented units of exemplary discipline excelling in military confrontations. We would be an embarrassment on the world stage to not take heed."
 aqt_frankish_knight_title:0 "Frankish Knights"
 aqt_frankish_knight_desc:0 "Despite our tired, tenuous history together, we may yet have use for the Franks. Many admirable traditions can be attributed to the northerners - including that of knighthood. We would be fools to let this go to waste - we must cultivate it and make it our own."
 aqt_legions_of_aquitaine_title:0 "Legions of Aquitaine"
 aqt_legions_of_aquitaine_desc:0 "Our realm has achieved a vastness it has never had before. Fittingly, it should boast armies vast - tens of thousands of men, whipped into fighting form, frenzied by loyalty and devotion to the fledgling Aquitanian phoenix. These men should be cast of iron, of knightly form, of indestructible resolve... Under our leadership, they will come to be."
 aqt_navarra_title:0 "Secure Navarra"
 aqt_navarra_desc:0 "The vulnerable Navarrese to the south have since time immemorial been troubled by outsiders. They have invariably secured for themselves sovereignty - however at what cost? They cannot truly support themselves or stand alone against the tyranny of the world. They should instead embrace our benevolent oversight... and if they require aggressive persuasion, so be it."
 aqt_fortify_pyrenees_title:0 "Fortify the Pyrenees"
 aqt_fortify_pyrenees_desc:0 "With our borders secured and our rightful sphere annexed, incorporated into our realm, we have unfortunately inherited not only wealth from our oppressors but problems, too. Namely, the Andalusian threat - the Saracens of old eternally looming to the south, eyeing the free Christian world hungrily. We must fortify the mountain passes against this threat - the Pyrenees shall become a wall!"
 aqt_artillery_title:0 "Cannons of Toulouse"
 aqt_artillery_desc:0 "Boasting an army proud and professional, it is only fit that we wield power tantamount to the trumpets of Revelations - cannons, of course, fit to obliterate even the strongest of fortress walls, designed to send armies scattering in fervour fearful, commanded to render unto dust all enemies of Aquitaine."
 aqt_toulouse_title:0 "Annex Toulouse"
 aqt_toulouse_desc:0 "A prosperous land lies in a state of vulnerability. To the south, the Saracens amass anew, plotting forevermore northern expansion, revenge for Valencia. To the east, the squabbling princes of the Holy Roman Empire, all various strange shades of Burgundian, Italian and god knows what else, eye the south of Francia greedily. It would be a travesty if outsiders laid claim to the beauty of Toulouse before we could claim it ourselves." 
 aqt_gather_allies_title:0 "External Support"
 aqt_gather_allies_desc:0 "The Franks have earned themselves many rivals over their long and whimsical history. The Saracens to the south, while they do eye our lands hungrily, may prove to be temporary allies. Even accursed Lotharangia may be seen as a brother for a time. Our arrogant overlords may in time learn to reap what they sow... for their enemies would leap at the chance to aid us."
 aqt_bourbonnais_title:0 "Subjugate Bourbonnais"
 aqt_bourbonnais_desc:0 "To the northeast, the splendid, rolling hills of Bourbonnais await. Through their sprawling forests and leaping countryside, our men shall march, if only we have the courage and resources to set forth. With the northern hegemony making a final stand, it is only fitting that these vulnerable lands fall into the right hands!"
 aqt_reclaim_cores_title:0 "Securing Aquitania"
 aqt_reclaim_cores_desc:0 "Lands vital to the Gascon sphere, historically ours, undeniably like-minded in culture and tongue, lay east of our reach. With Frankish authority brutally challenged by our insubordinate state, the Gascon common folk are rearing to fall under our banner, to be free from the Parisian oppression. We must make haste!"
 aqt_prepare_army_title:0 "Prepare the Army"
 aqt_prepare_army_desc:0 "We cannot hope to gain a foothold on the ladder to freedom without a standing army of decent order. The Frankish masses must be met on the fields of retribution with good and honest men - wielding cruel and bloodthirsty iron."
 aqt_revolt_francia_title:0 "Revolt Against Francia"
 aqt_revolt_francia_desc:0 "With our men amassed, our alliances drawn and our tactics brewing, the prospect of freedom has never been more tantalising. Already, word spreads - those Franks, peasants and lords beyond our borders trembling, waiting with bated breaths, for our inevitable revolt, the storm we shall unleash. Francia shall fall!"
 aqt_poitou_title:0 "Conquer Poitou"
 aqt_poitou_desc:0 "An eye for an eye. It feels only fitting that we strike back at Francia, seizing upon the opportunity to assert our newfound strength, by claiming new lands for ourselves. Just north of our borders, a vulnerable Frankish countryside awaits us - the silly peasants there are still in need of some 'Aquitanian correction'. We shall strike north - render these lands ours!"
 aqt_aquitaine_title:0 "Aquitanian Restoration"
 aqt_aquitaine_desc:0 "At last, southern hegemony is at hand. Our neighbors have willingly (invariably) fallen under our protection. The Franks have been pushed back, relegated to a northern sphere of influence. It is time we declare our identity to the world - a union of all Aquitania!"
 aqt_appanage_support_title:0 "Appanage Alliance"
 aqt_appanage_support_desc:0 "With the Frankish behemoth leering over us, we must seek allies. Those fellow ducal dukes beneath the Frankish authority may feel similarly to us, oppressed and smothered - perhaps we may find common ground?"
 aqt_upper_burgundy_title: "Upper Burgundy"
 aqt_upper_burgundy_desc:0 "It is only appropriate, with vast swathes of the Frankish realm now beholden to us, that Upper Burgundy soon to follow! A vital heart and crossroads of trade and cultural exchange, it is the next stepping stone in our rise to power."
 aqt_switzerland_title:0 "Integrate the Swiss"
 aqt_switzerland_desc:0 "Between mountain passes frigid and hardened, beautiful pastures await, toiled over by the diligent cantons of the Swiss. Since time immemorial, great conquerors and ravagers of nations have swept through these ancient valleys to strike at their fearsome rivals - the greatest mistake those rivals have made, time and time again, being their failure to secure the valleys proper. We will not make that mistake. Switzerland is ours!"
 aqt_south_germany_title:0 "Push Into Germany"
 aqt_south_germany_desc:0 "Across the silvery shores of the ancient Rhine, Germania awaits. Its southern extent in particular has seen a score of wealthy powers and triumphant houses - all of whom belong under our banners, not across from us on some wretched winter battlefield. Let us push east and consolidate German power!"
 aqt_britanny_title:0 "Latinize Brittany"
 aqt_britanny_desc:0 "A strange and foolish tongue has descended upon Brittany. Many centuries ago, foul Britons from across the channel fled to the rainy shores of the peninsula to escape the ravenous roaming Germans ravaging Britain. In turn, they have rendered Brittany a bizarre Celtic stronghold, one that persists into modernity. Enough of this rabble - a Latin tongue shall prevail in Brittany once again!"
 aqt_secure_channel_title:0 "Secure the Channel"
 aqt_secure_channel_desc:0 "Having achieved dominance over France, it is only appropriate that we make the channel ours, too! The channel today stands as one of the busiest and wealthiest zones of commerce in Europe, if not the world. We would be fools not to capitalise upon it and ensure we have a hand in all of its business!"
 aqt_prepare_fleet_title:0 "Build the Invasion Fleet"
 aqt_prepare_fleet_desc:0 "Ferocious Vikings, cunning English, barbaric Irish, wily Scots - they sneer at us from afar, making strange and primitive gestures which we cannot help but interpret as threatening. For the sake of Aquitaine's safety and future prosperity, we must consider naval supremacy a paramount goal - perhaps even consider the conquest of Britain outright."
 aqt_master_of_france_title:0 "The South Rises"
 aqt_master_of_france_desc:0 "The time has come! We have shed our shackles and built for ourselves the beginning of an empire! All France over - nay, Europe! - we are to be seen as undisputed masters of French identity and culture. We cannot neglect this moment and let it pass us by - we must seize the opportunity to rise higher than ever before! The new centre of France is ours - the south rises!"
 aqt_invade_england_title:0 "Defeat the Heptarchy"
 aqt_invade_england_desc:0 "The cold and cruel lords of England beckon to us from across the channel. Hardened by war and the treachery of their internal politics, the wily English plot without end to subjugate anyone who dares pass them by. Unfortunately, existing on their periphery, conducting trade with their merchants, and routinely harassed by their scheming spies, it is inevitable that we shall clash with them. We will never feel secure until the perfidious English are dealt a killing blow!"
 aqt_north_germany_title:0 "Conqueror of Germania"
 aqt_north_germany_desc:0 "With the Low Countries secured and the southern princes of Germany rendered loyal, it is only appropriate that all of Germany, all of this 'Holy Roman Empire', fall to our advancing legions. For a safe, prosperous and united empire, all of Germany must become a province, a vital and integral arm, to the Aquitanian realm."
 aqt_low_countries_title:0 "Control the Low Countries"
 aqt_low_countries_desc:0 "The Low Countries are a land of the respectable and wealthy. The Dutch have most certainly made a name for themselves - their impressive canals, their clever mercantile tactics, and their admirable tenacity. Unfortunately, they still need some work - notably, they still haven't understood the vast advantages of French culture and administration. No longer! The Low Countries shall be ours."
 aqt_destroy_francia_title:0 "The Empire's Downfall"
 aqt_destroy_francia_desc:0 "We would be fools to neglect the opportunity awaiting us. With the Franks on the back foot, we may make of them a pathetic enclave, or worse - a subjugated people outright. The tables are now turned! Our time has come. The era of Aquitaine is at hand!"
 aqt_lower_burgundy_title:0 "Subjugate the Occitans"
 aqt_lower_burgundy_desc:0 "The Occitans of the southeast are not dissimilar from us. They are not Italian, they are not Catalan, they are not Frank - they are closest to us therefore and deserve to be treated well... beneath OUR banner, that is! Let us absorb these lands and encroach upon Italy proper!"
 aqt_rome_title:0 "Legacy of Rome"
 aqt_rome_desc:0 "For centuries now, the heart of Christendom itself has been threatened, brutalised, violated by advancing Saracens. The likes of Andalus, Tunis, and Sicily, have been laying waste to the Italian peninsula, sweeping aside the squabbling faithful within. We cannot let them hold on to threaten blessed Rome any longer - we must protect Christendom!"
 aqt_sicily_title:0 "Sicilian Liberation"
 aqt_sicily_desc:0 "Having secured Italy's central extent, the question now stands - will we allow the status quo to rage on? Will we allow the Saracens of Sicily to continue tormenting the good faithful of the peninsula? Or will we turn the tide, march upon their holdings, and liberate those they have abused for countless centuries? Surely it is our responsibility as followers of the cross to see Italy come under a new era, one Christian!"
 aqt_latin_empire_title:0 "The Latin Empire"
 aqt_latin_empire_desc:0 "Across the Straits of  Otranto, the Balkans lay inflamed. Muslims encroach upon the ancient mountains of Greece. Where the first Christians once spread the good word, strange barbarians now preach even stranger ways. The Romans of so-called Constantinople have failed. The Bulgarians of Tirnovo cast greedy eyes upon everything in sight. The warlike Nicaeans sharpen their blades with animal glee. None of these powers can be trusted to guard Christendom! Only us, only the West, only a... Latin Empire, perhaps... may preside over Constantinople."
 aqt_unite_iberians_title:0 "Unite the Iberians"
 aqt_unite_iberians_desc:0 "The great Saracen hordes of Andalus cannot be easily overcome. Time and time again they have repelled efforts to oust them from Iberia - disaster striking in Valencia in particular, which in a roundabouts way weakened the Franks enough for us to cast off their chains. Despite how grateful we are for the opportunities granted, the Andalusians must still be repelled if Aquitaine is to have a future. Likewise, the good Christians of Iberia must recognise the need for a new crusade. They must unite beneath our banner!"
 aqt_valencia_title:0 "Avenge Valencia"
 aqt_valencia_desc:0 "Many decades ago now, the foolish Franks suffered a crushing and cataclysmic defeat under a harsh Valencian sun. While this was a boon to us and everyone else suffering under the Frankish yoke, it cannot be understated how humiliating and devastating this was for Catholic Christendom. The battle cannot go unavenged - we must retake Valencia and put the Andalusians in their proper place!"
 aqt_andalusia_title:0 "Challenge Al-Andalus"
 aqt_andalusia_desc:0 "The dreaded 'Al-Andalus' has been a blight upon Iberia for long enough! The downtrodden Castillians have had a bitter time trying to shed their chains - one we cannot help but relate to, having suffered beneath the insidious Franks for long enough. We will deliver the final blow to the ailing Saracens and remove them for good from the god-given lands of Iberia!"
 aqt_lombardy_title:0 "Challenge the Iron Crown"
 aqt_lombardy_desc:0 "The fierce and formidable Lombards have waxed and waned in might. Like many other fledgling powers of Italy, they have had their time in the sun and now must resign themselves to the history books. For their good - as well as ours! - we will take the reins from here on out and take the iron crown for ourselves!"
 aqt_settle_north_title:0 "Settle the North"
 aqt_settle_north_desc:0 "Despite the lethal cold which grips the New World's mysterious north, opportunities lay in wait. Our explorers tell us of fantastic amounts of fish, plentiful supplies of fur, and vibrant forests, all crying out to be claimed. It would prove difficult, but surely we could establish a new frontier amidst this new land."
 aqt_discover_america_title:0 "Discover America "
 aqt_discover_america_desc:0 "Across the treacherous Atlantic, a New World awaits. Long have the intrepid Basques whispered of fantastical new spots to catch whales, as have fearsome Icelandic sailors whenever they've wandered south. We are inclined to believe these are not mere drunkard tales - something may be awaiting us to the distant west..."
 aqt_hudson_bay_title:0 "Hudson Bay Fur"
 aqt_hudson_bay_desc:0 "The cold north of bountiful Canada beckons. With routes plotted and bases established, it is well within our capability to establish outright control over Canada proper and create a monopoly over the region's resources for ourselves."
 aqt_caribbean_title:0 "Land in the Caribbean"
 aqt_caribbean_desc:0 "The hot Caribbean invites us. Islands of marvellous beauty may be found amidst the tranquil blue waters, putting those of the Mediterranean to shame. Not only is this a vast and beautiful region of the world, a treasure on God's green Earth, but also a vital maritime crossroads. Our traders are clamouring for us to establish a foothold in the region."
 aqt_east_coast_title:0 "Control the East Coast"
 aqt_east_coast_desc:0 "A land of milk and honey beckons, stretching from the boiling heat of the Caribbean to the prickly chill of Quebec. Claiming this vast eastern sprawl, we could make of this untamed land a country domesticated, a country purposeful, a country powerful... a new Aquitaine!"
 aqt_louisiana_title:0 "Dominate the Great Plains"
 aqt_louisiana_desc:0 "Beyond the treacherous mountains of the east, beyond the winding rivers of the south, set aside from the scorching heat of the Rio Grande, great plains beckon, tantamount to the great Asian steppe of old. It is wise we capitalise on this great unclaimed stretch before our rivals take it for themselves."
 aqt_bordeaux_title:0 "Bordelais Grand Port"
 aqt_bordeaux_desc:0 "The sprawling riches of Bordelais cry out - they wish to be channelled through glistening ports! At such a location opportune, Bordelais stands today as a waste. If we were to make it a grand port for commercial ventures, mercantile interests and naval supremacy alike, Bordelais would be a shining jewel of our people." 
 aqt_develop_south_title:0 "Southern Prosperity"
 aqt_develop_south_desc:0 "For too long, the south has basked in the shade of the north. No longer! We will recover from the cruelty and treachery inflicted upon us by barbaric outsiders and reclaim our former glory, our rightful prosperity!"
 aqt_brazil_title:0 "Into the Amazon"
 aqt_brazil_desc:0 "With the vibrant coastlines of the New World secured, firmly within our hold, it is only appropriate that we puncture the interior. To follow the mysterious veins of the great Amazon is no easy task, but many foolish settlers under our command would be willing, tempted by tales of mighty, mystical cities and lost treasures. Glory and gold await!"
 aqt_college_title:0 "College of Toulouse"
 aqt_college_desc:0 "To match the great universities of Europe, the likes of which are to be found in the ancient urban centres of Italy and the frigid unyielding forests of Germany, we must make of our beloved Toulouse a beating heart of academia for our nation."
 aqt_industrial_expansion_title:0 "Industrial Expansion"
 aqt_industrial_expansion_desc:0 "Industry rises! Can you hear the roaring of the furnaces? Can you hear the pounding of the drums of war? Across the world, nations are transforming into nothing seen before. Workshops are becoming factories of countless production lines. Farmlands are becoming estates of industrial capability. We cannot be left in the dust - Aquitaine must be at the heart of this coming revolution!"
 aqt_increase_production_title:0 "Increase the Production"
 aqt_increase_production_desc:0 "Across Europe, entire empires not of borders, not of men, not of blades or cannons or steel, but of mercantile prowess, are burgeoning. Workshops boom, guilds bristle, entrepreneurs triumph - a new world is at hand, entailing cold hard coin and heavenly prosperity. We must not miss out!"
 aqt_wine_industry_title:0 "Vineyards of Aquitaine"
 aqt_wine_industry_desc:0 "It is no foolish claim to say we boast the finest wine in the world. It would be foolish, however, to claim that this boast will remain ours forever. In a changing and uncertain world, it is unwise to leave one of our finest assets undernourished. The vineyards of Aquitaine must remain the finest of Europe - nay, the finest of the entire world!"

 ars_master_of_puppets_title:0 "Master of Puppets"
 ars_master_of_puppets_desc:0 "The turn of the century brought unprecedented instability throughout Europe. As the bloody Hussite Wars and earth-shaking Crusade against Andalusia raged, many long-standing noble houses reigning over states in Europe could not stand the test of time. If they had not been wiped out by the Black Death half a century prior, they were finished off by internal conflicts - like the Frankish realm. New upstart dynasties occupy positions that they do not deserve, running through years of successfully accumulated legacies. As one of the oldest remaining houses of Europe, it is the Arelat responsibility to restore the houses of old and become the master of puppets."
 ars_thrones_of_europe_title:0 "Thrones of Europe"
 ars_thrones_of_europe_desc:0 "The situation in Europe is finally becoming clearer. With chess pieces in high places in many courts across Europe, they play a wicked game of marionette, pulling on the strings of kings and queens. At any time, they can be replaced with those loyal to us. Play the game of thrones, and emerge the master of puppets!"
 ars_rival_carolingians_title:0 "Rival the Carolingians"
 ars_rival_carolingians_desc:0 "The glory days of the Carolingian dynasty are long over. The dreams of a reunited Frankish empire that spanned large swathes of Europe are no longer a possibility - for the weak descendants of the mighty Charlemagne. It is time they are put out of their misery for the greater good of Europe."
 ars_reforge_arles_title:0 "Reforge Arles"
 ars_reforge_arles_desc:0 "With the unification of the Upper and Lower Burgundy, the Arelat state should now be consolidated whole to include the remaining Burgundian lands. May Arles be reforged in the flames of war, and let Europe witness our might!"
 ars_capture_paris_title:0 "Capture Paris"
 ars_capture_paris_desc:0 "As we bring the Frankish capital and seat of power into the Arleat fold, the legitimacy of the Carolingian dynasty has been unquestionably shattered. Many states in the region are beginning to recognise our growing dominance over France proper. If we demonstrate that we are the better rulers, they may even join us voluntarily..."
 ars_empires_downfall_title:0 "The Empire's Downfall"
 ars_empires_downfall_desc:0 "Even before the death of Emperor Francis, the appanages under the Frankish crown held significant sway in the imperial court, progressively campaigning for more and more autonomy to rule their realm. Now, as the last true Emperor lies dead and his replacement incapable, they fear that Lothair will attempt to centralise the realm and consolidate his power base in Francia proper in a desperate show of strength. As the strongest, most direct challenge to Frankish leadership of the region, they are advocating for Arelat intervention into Frankish affairs..."
 ars_francia_title:0 "Control West Francia"
 ars_francia_desc:0 "With the discordant Carolingians deposed, the upstart Hohenstaufens eliminated, the Bretons brought to heel once and for all, and the southern Frankish appanages subjugated - Arelat hegemony over West Francia has now been established. The Kingdom of Arles now holds undisputed legitimacy to rule over the entire West Frankish realm!"
 ars_avenge_valencia_title:0 "Avenge Valencia"
 ars_avenge_valencia_desc:0 "The Battle of Valencia in 1443 was a tragic defeat for the Christian cause, with the dim-witted Frankish leadership bringing the entire crusade to ruin, and the French heartland into turmoil without leadership. The Andalusians, while suffering extreme losses, emerged from the conflict in a much better position over the Christian states. Already, they are threatening another incursion into southern France - we must strike pre-emptively, and pierce through the Pyrenees to avenge Valencia!"
 ars_lothairs_crown_title:0 "The Crown of Lothair"
 ars_lothairs_crown_desc:0 "The lands under the crown of Lothair were once a part of the Kingdom of Francia, split apart and forevermore a cause of major conflict between the houses claiming descent from Charlemagne. Declaring itself independent from the Holy Roman Empire, many of the Lotharingian neighbors will be happy to see them brought to heel - if only to see themselves safe from the upstart Hohenstaufens. Of course, the rich Wallonian and Flemish lands are nothing to scoff at either."
 ars_secure_brittany_title:0 "Secure Brittany"
 ars_secure_brittany_desc:0 "The Bretons in the Armorican Peninsula are no stranger to French overlords, yet never completely loyal either. As the only remaining group of Celtic people on the European mainland, they will need to be willingly integrated into our realm before one can be sure France can be considered fully consolidated."
 ars_normandy_title:0 "Ducal Ring of Normandy"
 ars_normandy_desc:0 "With Normandy reconquered, the council deliberates on the fate of the historic Duchy and the chaos that it has caused over the centuries. On a pedestal in front of court lies the Ducal Ring of Normandy. It is decided that the ring must be destroyed, to symbolise that Normandy shall no longer be an independent demesne."
 ars_low_countries_title:0 "Invade the Low Countries"
 ars_low_countries_desc:0 "While the Mediterranean holds the legacy of the oldest trading lanes, the North Sea ports have rapidly become the most important, with lucrative trade supplemented by the Hanseatic trade league. The Lowlands especially hold many such key ports, in addition to the flourishing textile industries further inland. Conquering the region will ensure Arelat wealth will have no bounds!"
 ars_holland_title:0 "Control Holland"
 ars_holland_desc:0 "Holland is the cornerstone of the Low Countries, with an aspiring legacy of seafaring and shipyards symbolic of naval power. To preserve this legacy, and ensure the knowledge held by the local peoples is not lost - like much during the Middle Ages - the Arelat court must guarantee their interests."
 ars_english_channel_title:0 "Monopolize the Channel"
 ars_english_channel_desc:0 "While the English crown twiddles its thumbs dealing with numerous internal conflicts, we are free to harness the rich trade between the Channel and the North Sea. The Hanseatic states in particular are more keen to trade with fellow, stable imperial states, instead of unpredictable regional usurpers who pursue short-term gain and long-term failure."
 ars_switzerland_title:0 "Subjugate the Confederacy"
 ars_switzerland_desc:0 "The Helvetian Confederation of Swiss states lies between a crossroads of cultures and is important for both inland trade and military ventures between Eastern and Western Europe. Subjugating the cantons along the mountainous terrain will give us an unassailable foothold in Europe."
 ars_piedmont_title:0 "Control Piedmont"
 ars_piedmont_desc:0 "Italy is one of the most developed regions in the world, where fertile farmlands lie aplenty between the northern Alps and the Appenine mountain range. With mere middling powers in the central areas, the northern demesnes of Visconti Lombardy and the Doge of Venice are the only powers competing for control over the area. The Viscontis, an extremely wealthy family who purchased the Iron Crown of Lombardy from the crippled Frankish court, are not seen favourably among the imperial princes nor the electors. Unsullied by the recent crusades, the Lombard heartland and the Po Valley are ripe for the taking - for those who dare."
 ars_iron_crown_title:0 "Don the Iron Crown"
 ars_iron_crown_desc:0 "As the Lombard king unwillingly surrenders the crown once more to royal power, the Kingdom of Arles now controls one of the richest lands in all of Europe. With the Doge of Venice more interested in affairs past the Adriatic, Arles is free to unite the disorderly Italian states. The crumbling power of Catholicism in Rome cannot be restored unless the Italian peninsula is united under one cause..."
 ars_italian_wars_title:0 "The Italian Wars"
 ars_italian_wars_desc:0 "The mountain line between the Arelat domain and Italy, the Alps, hold highly defensible fortifications and have protected Italy's inhabitants for centuries. If successful conquest of the Italian domains is the goal, crossing this obstacle and securing both sides of the passes leading through the precipices is a necessity."
 ars_regnum_italiae_title:0 "Regnum Italiae"
 ars_regnum_italiae_desc:0 "In the decades past, the Pope continuously campaigned for a coalition of Italian states to confront the aggressively expanding Saracens, who grew their realm from the island of Sicily to much of southern Italy. Ultimately, they failed as a result of innumerable conflicts of interest. Now, with the northern half of the Italian peninsula united under the Kingdom of Arles, the Pope in Rome has a strong defender to stand by them."
 ars_middle_francia_title:0 "Restore Middle Francia"
 ars_middle_francia_desc:0 "When the Carolingian rulers once ruled the greater Frankish realm, each succession divided the lands, first into West, Middle and East Francia after the death of Louis. Then, with the death of Lothair I, the Middle Realm further fractured into Lotharingia and the twin Burgundies. To date, the Frankish realm has never been this fractured and disorderly. Slowly and arduously, the Kingdom of Arles has reclaimed more and more of the Middle Francian realm, and now we stand as the lands of Middle Francia of old are finally reunited back under a single house. Middle Francia returns once more - with the prosperity of both the Low Countries and the fertile basin of North Italy, the glorious kingdom once more stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean!"
 ars_imperial_restoration_title:0 "Empire of the Franks"
 ars_imperial_restoration_desc:0 "With the recent re-establishment of the Middle Frankish realm, many wondered if they would ever see the reunification of the entire Frankish Empire that the great Charlemagne once united. Threatened under Arelat hegemony over Europe, many smaller states voluntarily joined the banner in order to preserve their positions of power. Others who were not so wise were put to the blade. Now, with the Western, Middle and Eastern Frankish realms reunited under one name, one dynasty, one Kingdom, the realisation of the second Empire of the Franks is here once more!"
 ars_electors_title:0 "Influence the Electors"
 ars_electors_desc:0 "As Arelat influence stretches deeper into the German heartland, the long-standing ambitions of imperial ascendancy have become much more realistic. We will need to sway the imperial electors and align them with our cause, be it by pen or by sword."
 ars_ascendancy_title:0 "Imperial Ascendancy"
 ars_ascendancy_desc:0 "It is done! The last emperor is indisposed, and the electors have seen fit to elect the mighty king to ascend the imperial throne. The time is now - uniting the empire under a single house is now a God-given task that only he can do."
 ars_protect_empire_title:0 "Protect the Empire"
 ars_protect_empire_desc:0 "While imperial presence in the west deters those who dare to fancy imperial lands, the eastern frontier is a different story entirely. Usurpers from outside the empire have seen fit to occupy rightful imperial lands under the weak protection of the previous emperors. This situation must be rectified immediately, and all who think that they can take what is not theirs must be reminded of what the imperial banner stands to represent!"
 ars_become_an_elector_title:0 "Become an Elector"
 ars_become_an_elector_desc:0 "The affairs of the Holy Roman Empire are a complex and time-consuming issue. More often than not, prince-electors of the empire are able to influence the lesser princes through bribes in order to tip the balance in the favour of their own benefit. By taking the position of elector for the Arelat court, there can only be positive outcomes - and possibly even becoming the Emperor of the Romans."
 ars_great_power_diplomacy_title:0 "Great Power Diplomacy"
 ars_great_power_diplomacy_desc:0 "The current state of affairs in Europe is a far cry from the time of a realm united under one name. Many of the imperial princes think themselves mighty and worthy of respect; unwilling to align themselves to a cause greater than their own. Those outside the imperial borders threaten its prosperity. Ensuring they all understand where their positions lie will be important. If they reject our diplomats, perhaps harsher diplomacy is needed instead..."
 ars_romanesque_title:0 "Romanesque Architecture"
 ars_romanesque_desc:0 "The Roman architect and military engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio authored a treatise detailing the idea that all architecture should have three attributes: strength, utility and beauty. Its many lessons were later adopted by the wider Roman architecture. Many such admired examples still stand in former Roman Gallic cities, especially our Arelat heartland. These will only serve to assist us in erecting more illustrious and adorned buildings."
 ars_production_title:0 "Increase the Production"
 ars_production_desc:0 "With the Arleat domain ever-expanding, so does the size of the military to protect the borders. To support such an expanding military, we will need to grow the industries that support not only the war machine but the families of these loyal soldiers and their hometowns. Developing new industries will be key to a stable future."
 ars_quilts_title:0 "Marseilles Quilts"
 ars_quilts_desc:0 "Marseilles is iconic for its high-quality silk and textiles, in particular the quilts. These quilts, named 'Broderie de Marseille' were amazing works of three-dimensional sculpting onto soft fabrics. Traders from the nearby mercantile Genoa, Venice and Hansa have long been patrons of these Marseille Quilts because of the premium prices they fetch everywhere in Europe. By supporting the professional needlewomen who produce such artful quilting and directly funding the growth of the Provencal textile industry, we enrich the state tremendously."
 ars_heartland_title:0 "Develop the Heartland"
 ars_heartland_desc:0 "As the Kingdom of Arles expands its borders ever further, resources will be spread thin throughout the realm, and the growth of the Provencal heartland will eventually stagnate. The royal court will need to directly facilitate the growth of the capital region, to ensure migrating people can live in conditions befitting the seat of power!"
 ars_royal_palace_title:0 "Palace of Arles"
 ars_royal_palace_desc:0 "First constructed in the mid-13th century, the Royal Palace of Arles was not completed until over a century later. The Palace, itself a hallmark of Gothic-style architecture, is composed of two distinct phases - the Palais Vieux (Old Palace) and Palais Neuf (New Palace). Overlooking the river Rhone and sitting on a naturally rocky outcrop, the Royal Palace of Arles is both a grandiose central court and an intimidating, impenetrable fortress to those who dare gaze upon it."
 ars_university_title:0 "Establish the Royal College"
 ars_university_desc:0 "Embracing the Renaissance is but the first step towards enlightening our populace. By making sure there are sufficient funds for erecting proper tuition facilities in the capital, new and innovative ideas will naturally spread throughout the Kingdom."
 ars_manufactories_title:0 "Invest in Manufactories"
 ars_manufactories_desc:0 "With the advent of global trade rising rapidly as a result of European colonialism spreading across the entire world, supply has never been lower than before, and demand has never been higher. Many high-quality textiles in particular have multiplied in price, leaving greedy merchants to exploit the gaps in the market for their own profit. Arles must ensure that they are not the only ones to benefit from this!"
 ars_chambres_title:0 "Chambres des Comptes"
 ars_chambres_desc:0 "The Chambres des Comptes, or 'Court of Auditors' was the first sovereign court in France specialising in financial affairs. Overseeing public spending, protecting crown estates, adjudicating related matters of law, and most importantly auditing the accounts of crown officials, the Court of Auditors would become the basis of the financial and legal systems that the French kingdoms would be famously known for in the future."
 ars_vineyards_title:0 "Burgundian Vineyards"
 ars_vineyards_desc:0 "For over fourteen centuries, the temperate Burgundian lands have been home to the world's most exclusive vineyards specially cultivated for Burgundian red wines, or 'Burgundies'. Upper Burgundy lying inland means availability of the Burgundies is limited by transport along river systems, further enhancing the rarity of the wines. Developing these vineyards and limiting the exports of Burgundies would encourage foreign wealthy merchants and nobles to pay any premium set by the Arleat court."
 ars_toulon_dockyards_title:0 "Toulon Dockyards"
 ars_toulon_dockyards_desc:0 "Toulon is an ideal location for the construction of a brand-new naval dockyard. With a new port, the future possibilities for the Arelat people will be endless!"
 ars_arelat_arsenal_title:0 "Arelat Arsenal"
 ars_arelat_arsenal_desc:0 "If we are to supplement our expansionist tendencies around the Mediterranean and beyond, we must secure proper naval infrastructure, maintain a strong fleet, and a steady flow of armed, able-bodied men."
 ars_harness_title:0 "Harness the Mediterranean"
 ars_harness_desc:0 "For as long as time, the Mediterranean Sea has been home to the most lucrative trade routes in the world - particularly to and from the spendthrifty Byzantines. Their share of the trade has declined significantly in recent decades under the administration of the decadent Angelos, and with their once mighty fleet scuttled, the eastern ports are plagued by raiders. If one could build a sufficient navy to protect the sea lanes, trade could be easily diverted to Arelat ports. It would be remiss not to exploit these sea lanes for the prosperity of the realm..."

The once fertile lands of the Bohemian Crown now bear the scars of immolation and destruction, a grim testament to the ferocity of the conflict. Famines, once strangers to our prosperous realm, have become frequent visitors, gnawing at the vitality of our people. The population, once teeming with life, has been drastically reduced, leaving vast tracts of land desolate and abandoned.\n\nYears have passed since the end of the war, yet the harsh effects can still be felt in every corner of our nation.

Although the Moravian kings attempted to Christianise Silesia, the holy heart of the Slavic faith, the highlands proved too arduous of a journey for their weak missionaries, and they were ultimately unsuccessful. It falls to us to continue the process and break the unity of the Slavic belief."
 bra_control_barlin_title:0 "Control Barlin"
 bra_control_barlin_desc:0 "The Veliti priest-kingdom stands as the biggest threat to @[Root.GetTag]. With their control over the Sorbian duchy of Lusatia, they maintain the largest border with us. The paltry attempts of their chieftains to convert border towns back to Pagan barbarism are a minor annoyance at best, but we cannot let these matters go, lest our own people think our house weak. The best show of strength against these threadbearers will be to conquer their capital Barlin and appropriate it for better use under German hands."
 bra_expand_new_capital_title:0 "Expand the New Capital"
 bra_expand_new_capital_desc:0 "Our new capital in Barlin should be as opulent as the Hanseatic cities if we have any self-respect."
 bra_commemorate_title:0 "Commemorate the Crusades"
 bra_commemorate_desc:0 "Our new capital in Barlin lies in what was once the heart of the now fragmented Wendish lands. Now that their threat has been neutralised and the Wendish people integrated into our kingdom, we should build a monument commemorating the Crusades against the Baltic Pagans. It shall stand as an eternal memory yet a gateway to a new beginning."
 bra_piasts_title:0 "Unite with the Piasts"
 bra_piasts_desc:0 "The Piast legacy of Poland has been besieged on all sides by their once Slavic brothers before Mieszko's fateful conversion to Christianity plundered the region into chaos and infighting. The Polish Catholic people have long been exhausted, and any relief we provide them will clearly be welcomed with open arms."
 bra_crown_of_poland_title:0 "The Crown of Poland"
 bra_crown_of_poland_desc:0 "Our union with the Catholic Polans centred in Poznan has resurfaced the talks of a reunification of Poland. We can make use of these claims, reintroducing the Kingdom of Poland under a junior partnership. This will give the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] legitimate sovereignty over the Polish people!"
 bra_rise_of_prussia_title:0 "Rise of Prussia"
 bra_rise_of_prussia_desc:0 "Even armed with the knowledge that the Pruthenians would fight to the last man, our generals did not believe it would be quite so literal. The Old Prussians, remembering the brutal times during their war against Poland, refused any diplomacy with Christians and instead opted to meet us with fire and steel. Massacred to the last man, the majority of the Old Prussian towns will need to be rebuilt from the ground up. Such determination against a superior foe should only be respected if not deemed futile. The Prussian name shall henceforth become a part of our greater realm!"
 bra_conquer_pruthenia_title:0 "Conquer Pruthenia"
 bra_conquer_pruthenia_desc:0 "After the Catholic king Mieszko united Poland, he turned north against the Pruthenians. By striking deals with the Hanseatic League, they were able to besiege the Old Prussian lands from both land and sea. Likely underestimating the determination of the Pruthenians and the size of their amassed treasury from the Amber Road trade, they were very quickly able to rally with distant support to the east, and both sides quickly suffered devastating losses. Yet to recover even generations later, we shall finish what Mieszko could not and bring Catholicism to Old Prussia."
 pru_found_konigsberg_title:0 "Found Königsberg"
 pru_found_konigsberg_desc:0 "The ruination of Pruthenia follows the bitter determination of the Old Prussian natives, and it is left to us to rebuild what was destroyed. Konigsberg is an ideal location in the east and a perfect location for the continuation of Die Ostsiedlung. An easily fortified position upon a river, supported by trade posts in the nearby port towns and an old Amber Road terminus, remodelling the region to the vision of House [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] will ensure a permanent legacy in Eastern Europe."
 pru_found_marienburg_title:0 "Found Marienburg"
 pru_found_marienburg_desc:0 "Much like its twin Prussian city of Konigsberg, Marienburg will stand as a stronghold against invaders from the east. As the gateway to the historic heart of German Baltic trade in Danzig, Marienburg will need to be an impregnable impasse. Supported on one side by the Vistula delta and close to the centre of Old Pruthenia, the new castle will radiate our strength throughout the entire region."
 pru_defeat_lithuanians_title:0 "Defeat Lithuania"
 pru_defeat_lithuanians_desc:0 "The Lithuanians are the most powerful of the Baltic chiefdoms, having amassed a significant realm through diplomacy and war alike. Though respect can be given to their independence they are but the final roadblock in our campaign to expand Die Ostsiedlung along the Baltic coastline. They will not tolerate our beliefs nor willingly bow to our kings. The Lithuanians must be brought to heel!"
 pru_baltic_security_title:0 "Baltic Security"
 pru_baltic_security_desc:0 "As our forces complete the routing of Pagan forces, the sustaining of Die Ostsiedlung has been wildly successful. Our German brethren now litter the entire Baltic. Our brothers and sisters are now also our security, and any who dare threaten us will be reminded of who defeated the once peerless Roman legions."
 pru_ruthenian_crusade_title:0 "Ruthenian Crusade"
 pru_ruthenian_crusade_desc:0 "The Ruthenian princes lie squabbling amongst themselves, all vying to claim the legacy of the once splendrous Kievan Rus'. Threatened by the amassed hordes in the steppes of the east, their brotherly alliances are only as strong as their will to fight to the last man. Without unity, they are open to conquest, and the reclaiming of Kyiv will be imperative to reaffirm the Catholic faith throughout Eastern Europe, and perhaps even mending the Schism of centuries past."

The only thing protecting us from the Sicilians is the Papal States, but it is also the only thing that is holding us back.

If we are truly to re-establish our great kingdom, we must recover our lands and drive out the Sicilians permanently.

 trc_palace_title:0 "Palace of Palermo"

 trc_two_capitals_title:0 "The Two Capitals"
 trc_two_capitals_desc:0 "Within Trinacria's claim to the Two Sicilies, there are two cities of large importance: Napoli and Palermo. While Palermo is our historical seat of kings, Napoli is also a large city with potential for administrative and diplomatic benefits. We should recover both, and ultimately decide what we should do with the cities. Is it wise to have two capitals?"

 sax_first_desc:0 "Despite our weakened state, Saxony was once the greatest of the German realms, with a long history of dominance. First mentioned by Ptolemy in antiquity, we successfully usurped Germany from the Carolingians and claimed the title of Roman Emperor for ourselves for a time. We have a legacy that few others can match."

 sax_second_desc:0 "Who was it that bested the Slavic war bands time and time again in the North? Who was the bulwark against the Danes? Who staved off both the Roman and the Frank for centuries? We Saxons are tough and determined warriors to the last, and our more recent calamities have only strengthened our resolve."
 sax_third:0 "Primus Inter Pares"
 sax_third_desc:0 "In Saxony, administration requires a much more personal touch. Our politics and government are more local and mediated than the Franks or Swabians, and to rule, one must tie the many feuding lords to the monarch through gifts and personal gravitas."

 sax_fifth_desc:0 "Our land is too divided, giving us limited control over our subjects. Large magnates run amok in our territory and must have their power broken. By dividing these grand estates into smaller governable ones, through the strategic appointment of bishoprics and charter towns, we can exploit our land much more efficiently."

Outside threats, such as the Hanseatic League and their policy of protectionism or the vengeful and barbaric Pagans, and inside threats of religious strife between Old Norse and zealous Catholicism, have raised the need for a strong army ready to defend from both."

From our humble beginnings in Schleswig-Holstein, under the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor and its mighty authority, we are finally able to stand on our own without foreign support. By combining the legacy of pagan Denmark with modern ideas spreading through the Christian world, a Danish restoration will encourage a new dawn for our people; let us unite in our cause and expand our ambitions to unite Scandinavia!"

When Charlemagne conquered them centuries ago, he claimed the Iron Crown for himself and became the new ruler of Italy. Centuries later we have done the same, crowning our ruler with the same Iron Crown that our founder once wore. The peninsula is ours once again, this time forevermore!"

How can we truly be the master of Europe when these barbaric, hut-dwelling, vile, disgusting people known as the English continue to flaunt their naval dominance? No more, says the admirals and rulers of Francia. A naval build-up to not only rival but surpass the Royal Navy is in order."

The failure of numerous crusades in the south, the lack of power projection from the emperor, and Papal manoeuvres that undermine imperial authority have turned Italy into a de facto-independent region. Now that we have removed all threats of Saracens in the south, we now turn our attention towards the remaining states. We will secure their loyalty by diplomacy or force of arms."

 frc_lothair_crown_desc:0 "Lotharingia was once part of a greater Carolingian Empire, but due to inheritance and centuries of lacklustre wars, the Kingdom has maintained its independence from the two other successor states surrounding it. Conquering the lands of Lothar will give us direct access to Germany proper, allowing Frankish control to reach even the barbaric Germans."

 frc_arles_throne_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Arles has been part of the Holy Roman Empire ever since its conception, but the culture itself is tied more towards Frankish instead of German.

The fish in the sea and furs inland provide food, warmth, and money to the Frankish colonial empire that is growing. It is also a good place to send our prisoners who just barely dodged the death sentence."

 frc_african_trade_companies_desc:0 "Africa is nearly impossible for our current administration to govern properly. It is diverse, hostile, and filled with kingdoms and states that seek independence from our benevolent rule. Obviously the right solution to this dilemma is to grant the lands in Africa to our own trade company to govern for us. Their profit maximisation tactics and the fact that we do not need to pay nearly as much to govern the lands makes it an easy choice overall."

While some insane dreamers see the Suez region as an optimal place for a canal, we see the fact that the only way around Africa will be that cape.

However, success is all that comes towards Francia.

 ab_francia.36.d:0 "The Normans have an infamous history with Francia and Europe as a whole. Descending from viking raiders, they conquered Sicily from the Eastern Roman Empire under Robert Guiscard, raided numerous castles and cities across north Africa, and participated in the great holy wars of the medieval era. In a sad turn of events, the Sicilian Normans have fallen into obscurity from Saracen conquest and the Normans in Francia lost their power in a failed invasion of England under William the Bastard. Now that we have claimed the title of Duke of Normandy for ourselves, we must reflect on what their legacy means for Francia as a whole. Will we take up the mantle of liberating Sicily for the empire and glory of Christianity, or will we avenge the battle of Haestingas and claim the throne of England for the glory of the Carloingians."

For most of those years, it has been synonymous with the Empire, but now we are presented with a choice. The people of Europe are becoming disillusioned with religious leadership as the basis of our government, and some wish we could truly return to the glory days of the Franks, without all the talk of investitures, crusades and ex-communication that have plagued our politics for centuries.\nTonight, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] personally wrote two letters, with completely different contents but the same destination - Rome. The first is a scathing condemnation of the institutions of the Holy Roman Empire, riddled with every single slight committed by the Pope against imperial authority. The second is a simple confirmation that, now that we have the power for it, we will continue administering Europe in God's name. Either letter could depart tomorrow and change the course of our history forever. The choice now lies in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands."

The Caliphate of Cordoba, the odious bastion of the infidels who claimed the lives of our best and brightest many years ago, has been put down like a rabid dog. Now that Iberia lies in our hands, it is our choice what to do with this greatly troubled land. While many of its Christian inhabitants would love for it to remain directly in our hands, fearing incursions from Africa may steer the region yet again to Islam if we aren't there to protect them, the Spanish generals who fought with our army have proposed that the land be divided between them, as part of the empire.

Not only does our banner soar, our tongue flourish, our culture dominate, but so too does the very notion of Francia and its noble ruler. The indignant princes of Germany, hundreds as they are, begrudgingly answer to us. The robed clerics of Rome, squabble as they do, speak of us with reverence. Traders far and near tell glowingly of all that is Holy, Roman and Imperial - courtesy of all-consuming, all-pervading, all-righteous Francia, ascendent, having tightly gripped the reins of the disorganised empire and its flailing electors.

Instead, our colourful and charismatic kings, a long and ancient line by now, have created for us a new legacy, via efforts not necessarily cooperative and cohesive but consistent in success and might. The Frankish blade is feared the world over - so is its tongue, spoken in the highest and most official of courts. Many people have surrendered to our banners and accepted, just like the Romans of old, our superiority and grace, marvelling at our culture, at our ways, at our achievements.

As the Northern bastion against a sea of barely more than barbarians, it is our strident duty to make sure Italy shall never be conquered. With the best in fortification technologies and the understanding that if we fall, the whole peninsula shall be overrun, our reputation is that of the Grand Bulwark, the rock on which waves of our foes will break. We will beat any would be invader into humiliation and submission!"

 nce_first:0 "Grimaldi Rule"
 nce_first_desc:0 "The Grimaldi family has ruled our little bishopric on the Mediterranean coast since our divorce from Genoa two centuries prior. As stewards of the state, Grimaldi bishops are traditionally the second sons of the main line of the family, and thus succession is from uncle to nephew, allowing for a degree of separation between our rulers even as they keep vital institutions in place. And none perhaps as important as our deep lines of credit with the Genoese elites, allowing for easy access to inexpensive loans and bolstering financial ties abroad."
 nce_second:0 "Commercial Bishopric"
 nce_second_desc:0 "Though our bishop is nominally only steward of the diocese of Nice itself, as a consequence of our founding the Bishop serves a dual role as elected head of the city council, similar in theory to the Genoese. It is said that Francis Grimaldi, to capture the rock of Monaco, had to take the vows as a priest, and thus could only rule the fortress and later the whole county as elected Bishop. As a result of our peculiar governance, with the Bishop serving commercial interests as much as religious, trust in the institutions of state is high, as the Bishop is dually responsible."
 nce_third:0 "Ligurian Ties"
 nce_third_desc:0 "It is no secret that our ties to the Genoese run deep - after all, we were once part of their republic. Across the whole of Liguria there are many who remember the Grimaldi family's rule in Genoa as a time of great prosperity, and are thus more susceptible to our overtures. Trust towards Nice is strong, and the kindness and goodness of our state is well known."
 nce_fourth:0 "The Grand Port"
 nce_fourth_desc:0 "Along the Mediterranean coast, few places can boast of truly expansive harbours both as deep and broad as ours. With a strong naval tradition in shipbuilding the dockyards of Nice harbour ships bound for Sicily, Andalusia, Francia, Egypt, and more. From Bulgarian Tsars to Frankish Emperors we have built many a fleet for others, so we both know how our enemies ships work, and the best construction techniques to manufacture only the best craft for our own burgeoning fleet."
 nce_fifth:0 "Gateway to the Piedmont"
 nce_fifth_desc:0 "Piedmont is nearly surrounded on all sides by inhospitable terrain - with mountains to the South, North, and West, and Lombards to the East, it may as well be an island, save for one connection. With the only port serving the region, and the safest passage in and out, Nice acts as the bridge connecting Piedmont to the rest of the world. Thus commerce flows through our bustling ports and busy roads, which we have painstakingly maintained and upgraded to the highest standards."
 nce_sixth:0 "Enshrine the Italian Language"
 nce_sixth_desc:0 "Despite Latin being for most intents a dead language, only spoken by the aristocracy and church, it remains the official language of many far-flung states. Perhaps this served a purpose at a point where translators were not available, but with literacy spreading we should embrace the use of the language our people actually speak. Doing so would greatly lower the barriers for participation in civic life and pave the way for many bright minds to enter our service."
 nce_seventh:0 "La Belle, City of Victory"
 nce_seventh_desc:0 "Nice's history streches millenia back, and it was infact the Greeks who founded Nice, naming after Nike, the old heathen deity of victory. Though times have changed and we have shed our heathen past, our city still retains its old name. Alongside that is a newer name, La Belle, the beautiful, bestowed by none other than the Pope upon seeing the bustling streets, the magnificent gardens and mansions, brick roof-topped villas on the coast, glimmering under the afternoon sun. O beautiful city of victory, may you shine as a jewel on the Mediterranean evermore!"

 ivr_first_desc:0 "It is often said that good diplomacy uses a carrot and stick approach, but we prefer to keep what we are offering unknown. Grey eminence or duplicitous traitor, Ivrean counts care not for labels but strive to keep an olive branch extended from one hand and a knife hidden up the sleeve of the other. In the brutal world of Italian politics such measures are how we survive."
 ivr_second:0 "Golden Mountains"
 ivr_second_desc:0 "It has long been known just how resource-rich the Alps are. Since the days of Augustus expeditions searching for gold and other precious metals have been undertaken, but most of these, led by outsiders, have inevitably failed. What they don't know is that deep in the mountains west of Torino, there lies an abandoned mine, the Montagna d'oro, forgotten by all but us. Rediscovering the location of this ancient source of gold would undoubtedly be a boon for our state."
 ivr_third:0 "Battaglia Delle Arance"
 ivr_third_desc:0 "Every year, in the lead up to lent, in the town square of Ivrea, a massive carnival called the Battle of the Oranges is held. We celebrate the ouster of the tyrant of Asti from our lands, who was chased out by the townspeople with naught but stones and pitchforks after attempting to assault a villager. Volunteers play the young woman and tyrant, and at the end the tyrant is pelted by teams of townsfolk with oranges and other fruits. The yearly reenactment both serves as a reminder to our subjects of our benevolence compared to the tyrants that rule the rest of Italy, and as good practice lest the people need to defend our lands once again."
 ivr_fourth:0 "Senior House of Italy"
 ivr_fourth_desc:0 "As by far the most senior of the Italian houses, the House of Ivrea has a special relationship with the rest of the Empire. Though we once tried to take the whole of Italy, we were thwarted back then by more senior princes, who commanded deep loyalties in their feudal vassals. But half a millenium later, we have outlasted those old fools, and now the nobility of Italy look to us for guidance. And leadership we shall provide."
 ivr_fifth:0 "Stamp out the Reformation"
 ivr_fifth_desc:0 "The Reformation has spread throughout Europe like wildfire, and his Holiness has declared them heretics, to be reprimanded by word or by force. At the various Vatican councils on these new heresies, we have proposed a forceful and righteous approach, like we took with the Vaudois of Peter Waldo. And with the blessing of the Pope we have now begun our mission to stamp out the Reformation in Italy forever."
 ivr_sixth:0 "Bulwark of the North"
 ivr_sixth_desc:0 "Italy has been time and time again been invaded by would-be conquerors, only for these invaders to get checked at the formidable Alps. As the Northern wall protecting the Italian peninsula, the Alpine fortresses of Ivrea serve as the first line of defense, and we have repelled Burgundians, Franks, Swiss, Bavarians, Saxons, and more. The upkeep and maintence of the most up-to-date fortifications is thus a key policy of our rulers, and over the centuries we have developed a reputation as the Northern Bulwark, the rock on which waves of invading armies break."
 ivr_seventh:0 "Beyond the Piedmont"
 ivr_seventh_desc:0 "Since the turn of the millenium we have been mostly content to stay within the Piedmont and occasionally meddle in neighboring Lombardy and Liguria, but no more! We should have been Kings of Italy 500 years ago, and would have been if not for the oppressive notions of just wars. Now it is time to strike again, and we know better how to trick and appease the fickle elites of Europe. But what need have we for truces, for causes? Italy is rightfully ours, and take it for ourselves we must!"

Yet at Valencia nearly the entire Asti regiment was taken out of commission, and Count Alessandro II barely escaped with his life. In the aftermath, the treacherous lord of Ivrea marched on our castles, and we had no choice but to submit, lest our weary soldiers get cut down by well-rested enemies. But since then we have taken the lessons of battle to heart - there is no substitute for the real thing, as the cowardly lord of Ivrea shall soon learn!"
 aii_second:0 "Hillside Vinyards"
 aii_second_desc:0 "In the lands surrounding the castle of Asti, vinyards have sprouted up all over the valley hillsides. Indeed our land sometimes goes by another name: Monferrato, the fertile mountain. Since the 1260's, we have been cultivating and perfecting grapes, and now our local wines are aged to perfection. With Europe's most productive vinyards and the introduction of the highly-prized nebbiolo grapes from neighboring Cuneo, we are in a prime position to become the premier exporter of wines."
 aii_third:0 "Last Charge of the Crusade"
 aii_third_desc:0 "Alessandro the Bold, the brave count of Asti, was said to have personally ridden forth at the slaying of the Emperor Robert Carolingian, charging headlong at the Andalusians and killing many himself before being forced to retreat with the fleeing Frankish forces. Some say he had a death wish, fearing excommunication, while others simply chalk his actions up to recklessness, but we know that the brave knight of Asti was doing his sworn duty to his Emperor and the Pope. Though his actions are a distant memory, even today Asti generals study his tactics and hope to replicate his feats."
 aii_fourth:0 "Imperial Connections"
 aii_fourth_desc:0 "The Aleramici are an old family, having ruled from Asti for almost half a millenium. Naturally several of our members married into the Imperial Carolingian house, and all counts since Alessandro I are descendants of Emperor Rudolf. Thus we enjoy a privileged position within the Imperial court, whether we leverage that to simply curry favour, gain allies, or make a bit for the Empire itself."
 aii_fifth:0 "City of 100 Towers"
 aii_fifth_desc:0 "All across the Piedmont fortified towers have sprung up, but nowhere is this more exemplified than the great city of Asti. Though known for having 100 towers we in fact have much more, from the Roman-era Torra Rosa to the modern Torre Troyana. It is said that with every passing day new plans are being laid, and towers sprout so fast that travelers may hardly recognize individual landmarks after being gone for only a few years."
 aii_sixth:0 "Premier Condotierri"
 aii_sixth_desc:0 "While other Italian states look to unreliable bandit captains for mercenaries, we entrust service in our armies to only the finest of Swiss pikemen. Indeed our contracts with the Swiss are needed now more than ever as our enemies grow ever stronger. A healthy relationship and a reputation for reliable payments has also allowed us to both employ more condottieri and spend less."

The old Ivrean house once ruled a united Piedmont, but their impropriety, treachery, and wickedness lost them favor, and they declined into nothingness. We must strive to reunite the Piedmont under our own banner lest some other sinful lord take it first!"

 aqt_fourth_desc:0 "With the Cathars rooted out of Southern France and Gascony in Particular our lands are free from the influence of Heresy once more, and with the Ideas of the Reformation spreading at large it is our duty to remove this pest and influence from the lands of our people. Much like how the Frankish claimed the title of 'Elder Sister of the Church' we shall reaffirm this title in our own name to promote and finally remove the reformation from our lands."
 aqt_fifth:0 "Resilience of the South"
 aqt_fifth_desc:0 "The South has always been a land of Great fighters and coincidentally the South has been punished and paid more times for the crimes of the north than the north has paid themselves. In all scenarios where a war has happened the South was the one who had to pay the price in raids, sacks, and promises. Yet, the cities still stand and the people have only prospered under the defence of their forts and mountains. This history has influenced not only the military, but the ideals of their history."
 aqt_sixth:0 "Revival of the d'Oc"
 aqt_sixth_desc:0 "The Langue d'Oc was attempted to be destroyed and killed by the Academies of the Northern scholars in Francia, but the South resisted as these vile attempts and attacks on our culture continued. With many treaties being in the Langue d'Oc and many more to come the language is a beacon of Southern pride and some say nationalism. With our future before us, we will revive our language and expand it to all of France."
 aqt_seventh:0 "Mountain Industries of the South"
 aqt_seventh_desc:0 "In Aquitaine and many of the South the Mountains are rich in resources unparalleled to the largely Agrarian North, and with an economy and nation backing the mining of these mountains industries have been set up to profit off of these minerals. With the development of the Southern economy underway there is possibilities for economic advancement before us."

 guy_first_desc:0 "Gascony throughout its history has been a bastion of manpower and soldiers for the Frankish realm. Acting as a Southern March for the Reign of Charlemagne and going on to become one of the biggest defensive measures against the Andalusians in the South. The history of Gascony as such is shrouded in it's marcher status and has become a form of identity for the strong willed and spirited dukes and people of Gascony."
 guy_second:0 "Gascon Lineage"
 guy_second_desc:0 "Being one the Oldest of the Duchies within Francia. The Gascon Duchy was formed by the old kings of Francia themselves as a buffer state to hold sway over the basques. While the Crown of Francia focuses on outwards or internal affairs. Being the oldest of the ducal realms, Gascony has established a sense of precedent and sway over Frankish princes and has remained an integral party in the function of Francia. It is Safe to say that Gascony is the elder brother to all the ducal realms."
 guy_third:0 "In the Shadow of Aquitaine"
 guy_third_desc:0 "Gascon, a duchy that rivals the age of Aquitaine herself is a realm that was swamped by the shadow of Aquitaine's successes. Gascony however thrived within the shadow and aided in the fall of Aquitaine after her inevitable subjugation by Aquitaine. While not as prestigious Gascony in her own right was an influential duchy that rested in the shadow of her sibling's successes, yet, Gascony outlived her Sibling eventually becoming the successor of Aquitaine."
 guy_fourth:0 "Franco-Basque Hybridization"
 guy_fourth_desc:0 "Gascony, formed originally as the Duchy of Vasconia, was formed to manage the Basque who lived within southern Francia. The Duchy of Gascony while it has undergone many changes to its nomenclature: First Vasconia, Wasconia, Gascony, and then inevitably integrated into Aquitaine (And later again back as Gascony after being sold). Gascony has been subjected to the Franco-Basque merging of cultures as a melting pot between the basque of old, and the Franks. This has given the culture a unique dialect within the Langue d'Oc."
 guy_fifth:0 "Gascon Élan"
 guy_fifth_desc:0 "Gascon Soldiers have a sense of pride for the battles they have won or in general fought in. The Gascons displaying a vigour at any slight chance of victory inspires the soldiers with a vigour unmatched by her southern rivals, in such scenarios the Gascon Élan would go as far to win a battle alone and/or turn the battle's fate enough for the Gascons to recuperate and prepare for a counter attack. When fighting the Gascons imperatively rely on their soldiers' fighting spirit and discipline to turn the battle and gain momentum."
 guy_sixth:0 "The Duchy on the Garonne"
 guy_sixth_desc:0 "Gascony formed on the Garonne River has been both a cursing and a blessing for the Duchy. Giving her excellent defensive borders the river cuts through many valleys creating pockets of life and hindering the development of the Duchy, but it also has allowed the Duchy to grow in such a way that she is self-sustaining due to the blessing of the Garonne and the general fertility she brings. Over the History of the Duchy, the Garonne has been the site of many battles or sieges. Garonne, while being a curse for the development of Gascony, has defended her in more cases than it has harmed her."
 guy_seventh:0 "The Standard of Saint-Seurin"
 guy_seventh_desc:0 "The Standard of Saint-Seurin is a battle standard taken up by the Dukes of Bordeaux upon laying their sword upon the Altar of Seurin in the Basilique Saint-Seurin de Bordeaux. Upon laying their sword upon the stone they would receive the banner of Saint-Seurin much like the Oriflamme of Saint-Denis. The Standard of Saint-Seurin is a religious icon and symbol of war to the people of Gascony and has been the banner of southern unification within Francia for the Counts and Dukes of Gascony since they received the banner. The Banner, rarely used much like the Oriflamme, is only used in times of necessity to inspire religious and national fervour to those who lay eyes upon it."

The fall of large swaths of Francia to our armies has led to the complete destruction of the Frankish powerbase, and now we can further exploit the approaching power vaccum.

This is simply unacceptable. To ensure that everyone remains loyal, we will reform parts of the administration and create new ministries to manage the empire."
 lot_ministry_title:0 "Ministry of Colonial Affairs"
 lot_ministry_desc:0 "Our current colonies are not developing fast enough, and this is not optimal at all. A reform is necessary to expedite the process of colonisation to bring our empire closer and closer to the end goal of global hegemony."

 ##Missions
 sax_billung_diplomacy_title: "[Root.GetAdjective] Diplomacy"
 sax_billung_diplomacy_desc: "Humiliation's cold chains must be cast from our many limbs! Should we remain idle and allow ourselves to fester, those counts still under our command may develop aspirations of their own. The [Root.GetAdjective] name must not fall to the wayside!"
 sax_rein_in_the_counts_title: "Rein in the Counts"
 sax_rein_in_the_counts_desc: "We must not allow this disunity to grow prolonged. For as long as our lands are not directly administered by the crown, they are at risk of splintering even further. Enough is enough - Saxony must reign paramount!"
 sax_reunite_the_old_kingdom_title: "Reunite the Old Kingdom"
 sax_reunite_the_old_kingdom_desc: "Beneath the Ottonians of old, we knew great strength. Our holdings extended across the northern coastline and our word was seen as unquestionable - the Saxon ways flourished and flowered beneath the wisdom of our old and tested kings until the Carolingians saw fit to neuter us. No more, we must rise again!"
 sax_westward_expansion_title: "Westward Expansion"
 sax_westward_expansion_desc: "With our state's borders renewed and pushed outwards, we must turn west. With the threats in the east - German and Slavic alike - rearing their vicious fangs, we must not leave ourselves vulnerable to Dutch incursions or Hanseatic interference. An adequate foothold west shall cover our backs."
 sax_saxon_domination_title: "Saxon Domination"
 sax_saxon_domination_desc: "The time has come. Saxon domination is all but at hand over the empire's northern extent. If we are to have a future, a Saxon one, we must emerge as the dominant power in Germany, absorbing all that is vulnerable within our fold and banishing all that is rebellious and in opposition - crushing it if we have to."
 sax_eastern_frontier_title: "Eastern Frontiers"
 sax_eastern_frontier_desc: "For centuries, the Wends have stubbornly resisted the grace of God and his good son. The wisdom of missionaries has failed to penetrate their minds time and time again. Likewise, the blade of the righteous crusading army has failed to penetrate their armour to any lasting extent. This trend must be put to an end - the Wends must submit!"
 sax_blockade_hansa_title: "Blockade Hansa"
 sax_blockade_hansa_desc: "The petulant nuisances of the Hansa have stubbornly paraded themselves about the northern seas, fancying themselves Carthaginians of the cold north. The aspirations of the northern trade cities were at first respectable - their wily merchants wished to make a stand against Pagan violence by communicating in ways even they could understand, namely wealth and coin. In time, however, they have formed a formidable foe for us - one that must be put in its place."
 sax_control_the_straits_title: "Control the Straits"
 sax_control_the_straits_desc: "The tangled and cold straits of the Danes have long since stood as a gateway between the world of the frigid North Sea and the mysterious mists of the Baltic. To be the guardian of this mutual lane of exchange would ensure not only regional power but also deep respect from the merchants who conduct their business in the region. Should we claim superiority over the straits, we would know wealth untold."
 sax_march_against_wends_title: "March Against the Wends"
 sax_march_against_wends_desc: "With the eastern frontier transgressed upon and integrated properly, the Wends have been placed on the back foot. Rich and fertile lands, yet uncleared, stand ready for us. In time, the hymns of the only son and the word of the father may soon flourish - provided our march is strong and our swords sharp. For the cross!"
 sax_ostsiedlung_title: "Die Ostsiedlung"
 sax_ostsiedlung_desc: "Having established our unchallenged dominion over these brave new lands, Saxony's destitute are rearing for glory, in all their little peasant ways. Loggers yearn for new forests, miners call out for new depths, and merchants venture forth for new opportunities. In time, with sufficient guidance, they may very well become established and prominent in these new regions - becoming new regional identities outright."
 sax_blood_and_iron_title: "Blood and Iron"
 sax_blood_and_iron_desc: "With Saxony dominating all of Germany, our status as a powerhouse of the region is becoming more and more unquestionable. Try as the powers of Gaul may to exert their foul deeds upon us, vie as the Vikings do to dominate our northern extent, pry as the Czechs try to spill across the good and holy empire, they cannot deny our emerging supremacy. Our destiny is being forged in blood and iron - what of theirs?!"
 sax_claim_our_destiny_title: "Claim Our Destiny"
 sax_claim_our_destiny_desc: "Our lands have extended far beyond that of old humble Saxony. Our aspirations too are ranging far further. We envision skies boundless, bountiful, German. We glimpse the oceans limitless, painless, German. We hear courts pristine, flawless, German. All of this comes at the behest of our destiny, now more certain than ever - Germany."
 sax_rhenish_advance_title: "Rhenish Advance"
 sax_rhenish_advance_desc: "Into the powerhouse region of the Rhine, we must march. Rich and fertile lands, having become proud and prosperous over the centuries, await us. Only under our esteemed administration and tested military might will they become fully realised. The Rhine is ours!"
 sax_humiliate_lotharingia_title: "Humiliate Lotharingia"
 sax_humiliate_lotharingia_desc: "The strange and perplexing realm of Lotharangia - could it be said to even exist at all, even as it stands breathing and flexing? - stands as a testament to the utter disorder left in the wake of the unruly Carolingians. The natural order of Europe was perturbed by their squabbling, self-destructive tendencies, with perturbations persisting to this day, one of which is Lotharangia. Let us squash this disturbance at last."
 sax_sack_paris_title: "Widukind's Vengeance"
 sax_sack_paris_desc: "The humiliations of the past have not gone forgotten - nor will they easily fade from our memories. Our ancestors call out in our bones, beckoning us to march on the gilded gates of Paris itself. The cruel and indignant Franks will not know true defeat until their most cherished prize has been desecrated and rendered a smoking husk. March on Paris!"
 sax_seize_the_lowlands_title: "Seize the Lowlands"
 sax_seize_the_lowlands_desc: "The Low Countries, despite their title and status, are not quite beneath us in terms of importance. They are a vital heart of trade, a beautiful and promising coastal region and boast a booming population, one rife with prospecting sailors and naval aspirations. A fascinating people for sure - one we had best not make enemies with, nor neglect, lest we have another regional power to contend with. Into our fold, they must come."

 sax_marklo_title:0 "Rebuild Marklo"
 sax_marklo_desc:0 "Sacked by the Franks, and suffering through plague and internal conflict, Marklo is a far cry from what it could be. If we are to restore our power Marklo must be rebuilt."
 sax_overthrow_billungs_title:0 "Overthrow the Billungs"
 sax_overthrow_billungs_desc:0 "For far to long has Saxony chafed at the incompetent leadership of the Billungs, if Otto's legacy is to prosper, the Billungs must fall."
 sax_bohemia_title:0 "Weaken the Hohenstaufens"
 sax_bohemia_desc:0 "The Hohenstaufen stranglehold on Germany must come to an end if we are to ascend, and breaking their powerbase in distant yet wealthy Bohemia is a good place to start."
 sax_german_hegemon_title:0 "German Eagle"
 sax_german_hegemon_desc:0 "Like a phoenix from the ashes, Germany will rise again. We must follow in Otto's footsteps, and restore the old kingdom."
 sax_establish_royal_army_title:0 "Establish the Royal Army"
 sax_establish_royal_army_desc:0 "If we are to dominate Germany, we will need a strong army first. Establishing a professional royal army is a logical first step."
 sax_army_of_the_masses_title:0 "Army of the Masses"
 sax_army_of_the_masses_desc:0 "Mass conscription of all citizens would empower not only our subjects, but also allow us to create an even larger army."
 sax_nobles_and_generals_title:0 "Nobles and Generals"
 sax_nobles_and_generals_desc:0 "Experience in war and often left with too much time on their hands to scheme against the crown, we must find something to occupy the nobility. Making disciplined and strict military life the ultimate noble honor, should greatly improve our martial leadership, while also keeping the nobility off our backs. "
 sax_finest_of_germany_title:0 "Finest of Germany"
 sax_finest_of_germany_desc:0 "Through trials and tribulations, the Saxon army has proven the dominating force in Germany since the Romans or Attila. Let our legions be ever victorious."
 sax_shock_and_awe_title:0 "Shock and Awe"
 sax_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "It is obvious that artillery is only going to become more dominant on the battlefield as times go on. We should invest in an overwhelming firepower approach to these new innovations in order to gain an advantage on our neighbors."
 sax_clear_the_woods_title:0 "Clear the Woods"
 sax_clear_the_woods_desc:0 "Much of Germany is still heavily forested, and while it may hinder foreign invasions, it also stunts any internal growth. We should begin to clear the forests."
 sax_textile_industry_title:0 "Textile Industry"
 sax_textile_industry_desc:0 "Many European countries have grown wealthy on the textile trade, and Saxony will be no different."
 sax_braunschweiger_steel_title:0 "Saxon Steel"
 sax_braunschweiger_steel_desc:0 "Our vast iron reserves shall be exploited to the fullest, and fund our ever growing warmachine."
 sax_develop_westphalia_title:0 "Develop Westphalia"
 sax_develop_westphalia_desc:0 "Our western neighbors may be less hardy than us Saxons, but they do own wealthy land. We should integrate this land back into the hands of Saxons."
 sax_repopulate_saxony_title:0 "Repopulate Saxony"
 sax_repopulate_saxony_desc:0 "Devastated from years of invasions, plagues, and civil strife, Saxony has a long way to go before she can be a wealthy land again. Thankfully, new found efforts to develop Saxony are showing prospects, and we hope to continue these policies and restore Saxony to her rightful place."
 sax_ottonian_renaissance_title:0 "Ottonian Renaissance"
 sax_ottonian_renaissance_desc:0 "With European intellectual movements sweeping across the continent, we should harken back to the glorious Renaissance of our forefathers the Ottonians, and patronize these movements and ideals in Saxony as well."

#GermanMissions
 ab_germany_german_century_title:0 "German Century"
 ab_germany_german_century_desc:0 "A united Germany - a power spreading beyond that of any to our West or South? Surely, if we can accomplish these things, then our nation has far exceeded the mantle of greatness. We must recognize these feats, and proclaim the age dedicated to the Germans. "
 ab_germany_our_place_title:0 "Our Place in the Sun"
 ab_germany_our_place_desc:0 "Under the sun, the German nation has become a sight to behold, and why should we stop here? Only by expanding our borders and claiming our place among the strongest powers in the world can we truly find our place in the sun."
 ab_germany_kaiserreich_title:0 "Proclaim the Kaiserreich"
 ab_germany_kaiserreich_desc:0 "We have expanded beyond the realms that some even considered possible. Our influence stretches through Central Europe and beyond. Who is to stop us? Who is to stand against our might? Let them fear and behold the coming Empire - The Kaiserreich."
 ab_germany_regnum_title:0 "Regnum Teutonicorum"
 ab_germany_regnum_desc:0 "The Kingdom of the Germans, or Regnum Teutonicum, has a long and complex history. We are far from the first state to claim such a title and the lands associated with it. Therefore, in order to secure our legitimacy, we must secure the cities of historical significance and erect a new capital that best suits our goals."
 ab_germany_wendish_crusade_title:0 "The Wendish Crusade"
 ab_germany_wendish_crusade_desc:0 "When the good German peoples came to the one true faith, many refused to change their ways, and no group was as clearly opposed as the Wendish. For too long, these savage eastern peoples have sat on our border, refusing to acknowledge the truth. Therefore, we must show them what the sword of our faith truly tastes like."
 ab_germany_slavic_threat_title:0 "End the Slavic Threat"
 ab_germany_slavic_threat_desc:0 "As we continue to push east, we must not only conquer, but overrun the pagan Batic peoples. If we are to fully drive them from our borders, and ensure longing safety for our nation’s future, we must tear through their lands, destroy their armies, purge their gods, and in all sense of the word - eclipse them."
 ab_germany_amber_coast_title:0 "Harness the Amber Coast"
 ab_germany_amber_coast_desc:0 "The Amber Coast - a region of North Germany situated between the North and Baltic seas - is an incredibly rich area and one with great potential for economic growth. With the threat to the east dealt with, it is well past time that we take advantage of the trade in this valuable area."
 ab_germany_orders_title:0 "Establish the Orders"
 ab_germany_orders_desc:0 "The Baltic States, once a place of savageness and pagan rule, is steadily becoming integrated into our sphere of influence. During these events, questions arise as to what should be done with the pagan lands. Do we keep them for ourselves, or is there a better option? A proposed solution would be to establish Holy Orders there, to steward the people and oversee Christian rule. We should capture these lands quickly and make a decision on this matter."
 ab_germany_blood_and_iron_title:0 "Blood and Iron"
 ab_germany_blood_and_iron_desc:0 "The German Nation, once a mess of princes and feuding factions, has been pushed towards the dream of unity once more. Through Blood and Iron we shall fight. For our brothers, we push through the lands of the Rhineland, Bavaria, Saxony, Swabia, Westphalia, and beyond. Very soon, we shall stand as one."
 ab_germany_czech_throne_title:0 "Claim the Czech Throne"
 ab_germany_czech_throne_desc:0 "The Bohemians to our east have historically been Germans in all but name. The Czechs, once part of numerous German kingdoms and political institutions, are invariably linked to us in their cultural identity. Thus, we must absorb them into our growing state, for nationalistic and expansionist purposes, further elevating our glorious nation."
 ab_germany_konigsberg_title:0 "Found Königsberg"
 ab_germany_konigsberg_desc:0 "Continuing to look our eyes to the east, a jewel has been discovered that looks ripe for a rich settlement. Among the legacy of the Hansa settlements along the Baltic coast, a new city - Königsberg, has been discovered and proposed for renovations. If we are to do this, it could prove to be an invaluable investment that could boost our trade considerably in this region."
 ab_germany_fate_hre_title:0 "Fate of the Empire"
 ab_germany_fate_hre_desc:0 "For centuries, the lands of Germany have been under the thumb of the Holy Roman Empire, a loose conglomeration of disunited states. In the face of an impending united Germany, it is incredibly important that we deal with its legacy. Should we assume the mantle of this entity, leading it into a new age, or should we burn it to the ground, leaving its ashes in the pages of history?"
 ab_germany_swiss_title:0 "The Swiss Question"
 ab_germany_swiss_desc:0 "The Swiss have perpetually been brothers to the Germans in years past, and their participation in the Holy Roman Empire has only brought them closer to us in identity and friendship. For this reason, we should bring them into our protection permanently, absorbing their peoples within the borders of our glorious state."
 ab_germany_lombard_legacy_title:0 "Legacy of the Lombards"
 ab_germany_lombard_legacy_desc:0 "When Charlemagne created the Empire of the Franks, the German peoples were key participants in the empire. The Frankish peoples were, after all, Germanic in nature, and in the state they constructed - Northern Italy, commonly known now as Lombardy - was a land they ruled closely. If we are to elevate our prestige, we may be able to take advantage of this legacy and stake a claim for the lands that lie to our south."
 ab_germany_imperial_institut_title:0 "Imperial Institutions"
 ab_germany_imperial_institut_desc:0 "From the ashes of the princes that clogged the lands of Germany, our new united state requires a strong hand to unite us. Therefore, it is necessary to form a new government and make strong efforts to reform our political system into something that can accompany the growing German lands."
 ab_germany_reichstag_title:0 "Found the Reichstag"
 ab_germany_reichstag_desc:0 "With our new political system in place, we must find it a home. While, in time, the many lands of the Holy Roman Empire may succumb to fully centralized rule, the previous disunity of the states requires us to make concessions. One of these is the Reichstag: A council of the German peoples second to the king that will aid in political matters big and small. Let us establish this system and ensure political stability for years to come.`"
 ab_germany_frankish_revenge_title:0 "Revenge on the Franks"
 ab_germany_frankish_revenge_desc:0 "The Franks, once a German tribe themselves, resolved to distance themselves after the weakening of the old Carolingian Empire. No longer! These barbarous peoples must be brought back into the fold and into submission. Let us take revenge on the Frankish bullies and show these false Germans the strength of our sword and rifle!"
 ab_germany_ashes_of_the_west_title:0 "Ashes of the West"
 ab_germany_ashes_of_the_west_desc:0 "The time has come to end the Frankish threat once and for all. After our initial push into their lands, it has proved to be not enough. Paris is open for the taking, and controlling it could cripple their sad excuse of a government. Yes, let us overrun it and twist our sword in Francia’s bleeding open wound."
 ab_germany_ostsiedlung_title:0 "Die Ostsiedlung"
 ab_germany_ostsiedlung_desc:0 "As we vanquished the pagans to the east, the task arises to prepare these lands for German rule. Therefore, we must encourage Die Ostsiedlung, the migration of Germans to these lands to settle them and promote the right cultures and faith right for our stewardship."
 ab_ger_low_countries_title:0 "Secure the Low Countries"
 ab_ger_low_countries_desc:0 "Both a place of incredible trade opportunities and one with a  history that links them to German tradition, it would be outright nonsensical not to push into the Low Countries. The Dutch, Flemish, and Wallonians could prosper under our rule. Let us move into these lands with much potential, using them to our advantage."
 ab_ger_dutch_tradition_title:0 "Dutch Naval Traditions"
 ab_ger_dutch_tradition_desc:0 "With the Dutch bases under our control, our sailors have migrated to the areas and quickly realized the skill these people have in naval engineering and influence. This too must be exploited, building infrastructure to aid their shipbuilding and trade efforts on the high seas."
 ab_ger_control_hansa_title:0 "Take Control of Hansa"
 ab_ger_control_hansa_desc:0 "Trade has always been an important goal of the northern Germans. The Hansa, a collection of German trading cities, realized this dream most recently, and with their absorption into our nation, we should continue their efforts. Taking control of the Hansa, we must push them forward into the Low Countries, seizing important cities and extending our influence over the English Channel."
 ab_ger_high_seas_title:0 "German High Seas Fleet"
 ab_ger_high_seas_desc:0 "In extending our reach over the English Channel, we should begin to prepare a defense for our influence. The German High Seas Fleet must be constructed for this purpose, both furthering trade and ensuring our influence remains untouched."
 ab_ger_sound_toll_title:0 "End the Sound Toll"
 ab_ger_sound_toll_desc:0 "Our trade endeavors can not stop at building a fleet. Another profitable region lies to the north - the region of Scandinavia - yet the peoples there continually refuse our ships free passage. Let us show them our strength and strongarm them into giving our peoples free reign of their waters."
 ab_ger_north_sea_title:0 "Monopolize the North Sea"
 ab_ger_north_sea_desc:0 "The North Sea, once dominated by the Scandinavians and the British Isles, has steadily begun to capitulate to our trade endeavors. In order to ensure maximum profit, we must monopolize this opportunity and exploit the full amount this region has to offer."
 ab_ger_anglo_germanic_bonds_title:0 "Anglo-German Bonds"
 ab_ger_anglo_germanic_bonds_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the Saxons migrated from their place in Germany to meet with the Angles on the British Isles. After this event, the two tribes mixed to pave the way for the English we see today. Therefore, is it not true that these Englishmen are just Germans to the west? Germans outside of the German nation have no place as a nation at all. We must strengthen these Anglo-German ties and bring these lost men into their rightful country for ages to come, uniting Germans both east and west."
 ab_ger_rival_royal_navy_title:0 "Rival the Royal Navy"
 ab_ger_rival_royal_navy_desc:0 "England has been a pain in our backside ever since we assumed partial control of the English Channel. They have undoubtedly been the most influential on the region, claiming it as part of their nation itself. No longer. We must build a new, larger fleet, that can rival these silly Englishmen who are in our way and show them that the English Channel can become much less English."
 ab_ger_slavery_title:0 "The Question of Slavery"
 ab_ger_slavery_desc:0 "Slavery has been practiced for many centuries under different forms. With the rise of human rights however, many advocate for the abolition of slavery. We must make sure we settle this issue."
 ab_ger_cultural_union_title:0 "Cultural Union"
 ab_ger_cultural_union_desc:0 "Germany may be unified but her people are not, and they speak many dialects and hold many customs, caring little for the great realm. We ought to unify them into single strong people, able to build and hold the greatest empire in Europe."
 ab_ger_center_of_europe_title:0 "Center of Europe"
 ab_ger_center_of_europe_desc:0 "We should aim to make Germany the economic heart of Europe, and through this our new Empire can last another thousand years."
 ab_ger_imperial_capitals_title:0 "Imperial Capitals"
 ab_ger_imperial_capitals_desc:0 "The old cities of Frankfurt and Nuremberg have the political heart of Germany as far back as the Merovingians. Let us restore these imperial capitals to their former greatness, and compete with the power of London or Paris."
 ab_ger_army_of_the_masses_title:0 "Army of the Masses"

Old bureaucrats have made it clear that they would rather maintain the administrative status quo, but, with a country so rich and polycentric as ours, the case can be made for many appealing locations with great historical value. The Kaiser has narrowed the choice down to three options; Regensburg, built by Marcus Aurelius and Germany's very first capital under Ludwig II; Frankfurt, privileged and powerful, bustling with trade and growing at rates unseen in the region; Nuremberg, the Holy Roman Empire's unofficial capital under the Ottonian dynasty and oft-visited by German nobles in times of turmoil."

 ab_germany_pru_2_title:0 "A Militarized State"
 ab_germany_pru_2_desc:0 "The German lands have a long history of being threatened by foreign foes on all sides, whether it be the Franks who betrayed their Germanic brethren or the pagan Slavs who constantly raid the borderlands.

 ab_germany_pru_3_title:0 "The Reich Army"
 ab_germany_pru_3_desc:0 "Germany has known no armies save for the decentralised disgrace that was the Army of the Holy Roman Empire.

 ab_germany_hlv_1_desc:0 "Now that Germany is unified, we need to establish a unified army of the German Reich to replace the former princely retinues and messes. Without an army to defend ourselves with, we would fall prey to the other European powers who see our unification as a threat to the existing order."
 ab_germany_hlv_2_title:0 "Great Wall of Germany"
 ab_germany_hlv_2_desc:0 "We have long defended our autonomy zealously, just as how our other German brethrens have long defended the integrity of the German lands from all sorts of intruders. Though we are now united we are not immune to threats, we must improve our defenses with the most advanced fortifications and ensure those who wish to invade us will have a bad time."
 ab_germany_hlv_3_title:0 "Bank of the World"
 ab_germany_hlv_3_desc:0 "Gold and wealth are powerful motivators of men, and perhaps even more powerful motivators of politics and state management. We shall develop and enrich our businesses and become a center of trades and finances to become a global bank of the world." 

 #Germany Formed by Hansa Missions

 ab_germany_has_2_title:0 "Riches of Aztec"

 ab_germany_bav_3_title:0 "Indian Hegemony"
 ab_germany_bav_3_desc:0 "Instead of rewarding us with vast settlements in America, we have been granted the riches of India. This continent, divided amongst its princes, is ripe for conquest. Let us establish our hegemony in this world and continue onwards into the rest of Asia."

 ab_germany_swa_2_desc:0 "Swabia, being an important political and cultural center of the German lands, have experienced peace and prosperity.

 ab_germany_swa_3_title:0 "Global Dynasty"
 ab_germany_swa_3_desc:0 "Our dynasty has long had a talent for acquiring dispsuted thrones, whether it was the carved out realm of Lothar or the kingdom prone to heresy, Bohemia. We should further capitalize on our talents and go on to make our dynasty a global one, one with many thrones."

 #Germany Formed by Tirol Missions
 ab_germany_tir_1_title:0 "Alpine Mines"
 ab_germany_tir_1_desc:0 "The Alpine Mines have long been a source of wealth, not only for us but for those who were affected by its trade network as well.

 ab_germany_tir_2_title:0 "Global Diplomacy"

 ab_germany_tir_3_desc:0 "Alles Erdreich ist Deutschland untertan! No statement better encapsulates our view of this world and our ambitions better than this phrase.

 ab_germany_sax_3_title:0 "One Culture, One Germany"
 ab_germany_sax_3_desc:0 "Germany's cultural fragmentation is perhaps an internal representation of its political woes for centuries. A farmer from the Frisian coast would not be able to understand a brewer in Bavaria, nor would a Franconian friar understand a Meissener carpenter. It is time for us to end this fragmentation by centralising and standardising cultural practices so that our new unified Germany will be unified in both politics and soul."
 
 #Germany Formed by Franconia Missions
 ab_germany_fkn_1_title:0 "Control the Press"
 ab_germany_fkn_1_desc:0 "While the rapid advancement of printing has brought untold innovation across the continent, it is clear that for stability to be upheld, we must limit what these new documents can say. Let us guide the people of Germany towards a more calmer and less anarchic future."
 ab_germany_fkn_2_title:0 "Enhance the Doctrine"
 ab_germany_fkn_2_desc:0 "While our doctrine of rapid offensive mixed with shock and awe has worked wonders, it is clear there is still room for improvement. By placing further emphasis on movement at all costs our new German knights will be unbeatable at war!"
 ab_germany_fkn_3_title:0 "True Frankish Empire"
 ab_germany_fkn_3_desc:0 "While we might have conquered Charlemagne's old empire, ruling it will prove much harder. It was clear that the old Carolingians collapsed from internal division, and it is for this reason that we must uphold the ideals of the old Frankish nobility, and embrace all Europeans as brothers in arms."

#Germany Formed by Rhineland Missions
 ab_germany_rhl_1_title:0 "Modernize Fortresses"
 ab_germany_rhl_1_desc:0 "Our defensive infrastructure is clear from a bygone age of knights and castles, if we are to survive in a new age we must reorganize our defenses. Let us begin by update and strengthen our fortresses, in order to prevent another harrying by our neighbors"
 ab_germany_rhl_2_title:0 "Technological Advancement"
 ab_germany_rhl_2_desc:0 "Germany is home to some of the best and brightest minds in Europe, and we have given the rest of the continent many innovations in recent years. It is clear that we should use our ingenious subjects to discuss how best to reform Germany into a truly modern and powerful state."
 ab_germany_rhl_3_title:0 "European Economic Hub"
 ab_germany_rhl_3_desc:0 "Despite often being underpopulated and forested, Germany's central location at the heart of Europe is a major economic boon. With the right investments, Germany could come to dominate the European economy for generations to come."

 #Germany Formed by Styria Missions
 ab_germany_sty_1_title:0 "Grüner Veltliner"
 ab_germany_sty_1_desc:0 "The Styrian hills have long been known for vineyards that decorate the undulations as far as the eye can see. Though the winemaking techniques were lost after the Romans were removed from the region, the vineyards they cultivated remained, and a new wave of viticulture is re-emerging after the crush of war and plague has passed. To support our local economy, the Styrian winemakers will need to be supported."
 ab_germany_sty_2_title:0 "Extend Luitpold's Wall"
 ab_germany_sty_2_desc:0 "When Luitpold destroyed the Magyar menace at the Battle of Pressburg, he had the immaculate foresight to understand that they were not an entirely neutered threat. With their comparatively immense holdings in Carpathia supplanting their numerous subjects, there would come a time where the Germanic people would have to weather another invasion. To ensure our people are sheltered from such a scenario, we will need to maintain and expand Luitpold's Wall at the earliest opportunity!"
 ab_germany_sty_3_title:0 "The Eastern Spear"
 ab_germany_sty_3_desc:0 "History has proven to us that the Styrian enemies are all around, both outside the Empire and within. It is said that a good defense is an overwhelming offense, so we shall prove it true and rally an overwhelming army. We shall become the spear of the east and strike the hearts of all our foes!"

However, their successors continue to rule the powerful Kingdom of Francia, constituting the lands formerly known as West Francia. Such a large kingdom remaining within the empire will always threaten our continued emperorship. Many imperial princes and members of our court are beginning to whisper of formally expelling Francia from the Holy Roman Empire altogether. Such a severe act would mean relinquishing claims to the Frankish Kingdom as a subject, also likely outraging the Frankish rulers over such an unprecedented move. Nevertheless, the gambit may be worth taking, as it would allow us to consolidate our rule over the empire without dealing with a much larger and powerful subject."

 slv_capture_trst_desc:0 "Trst has fluctuated for many centuries— a Roman pawn in the distant past, a Venetian ally in more recent times, and a Frankish possession in others. Today, it is a fledgling city of foolish Venetian ambition— aspiring to latch on to local Adriatic trade and profit from luck and misfortune alike. It would do better under our rule —with the Slovenian tongue spoken on its streets!"
 slv_annihilate_venice_title:0 "Annihilate Venice"
 slv_annihilate_venice_desc:0 "Venice is an existential threat. Their grip over the Adriatic is like iron. Their word on the high seas is divine. Should we neglect their destruction, they may very well be our undoing in the future - either allowing enemies to engulf and devour us or choosing to subjugate us entirely, all in the name of profit. We must seize the Venetian homeland for ourselves!"
 slv_adriatic_hegemony_title:0 "Adriatic Domination"
 slv_adriatic_hegemony_desc:0 "Now that the Adriatic lays within our grasp, we must squeeze. We must squeeze until every last coin drips from this vital hub of trade and commerce. The sea is ours!"
 slv_establish_naval_forces_title:0 "Establish the Naval Forces"
 slv_establish_naval_forces_desc:0 "With our newfound access to the Mediterranean, it is only appropriate that we have a fleet to accompany our resurgence. We must establish a navy of our own to contest Venetian hegemony!"
 slv_merchant_fleet_title:0 "Merchant Fleet"
 slv_merchant_fleet_desc:0 "Now that we have laid claim to the Adriatic and created a fleet of our own, it is time to empower our fledgling merchant class with ships suitable for protecting and carrying trade. If we wish to contest Venice and the powers of the Mediterranean proper, we must have a merchant fleet!"
 slv_conquer_istria_title:0 "Conquer Istria"
 slv_conquer_istria_desc:0 "Istria is another example of a fine, beautiful coastline rendered a province of the Italian sphere of influence. A unique Italian dialect has flourished in its key city and periphery settlements and the Venetian banners fly proudly above its defences. We must amend this state of affairs - Istria belongs to the Slovenes!"
 slv_tomislavs_crown_title:0 "Tomislav's Crown"
 slv_tomislavs_crown_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the Pagan Croatian Tomislav, accompanied by his brother, secured the Croatian realm, ushering in a momentary lapse in instability. This, to our impeccable historical knowledge, is the only time the Croatians could rule themselves in recent living memory. Fortunately, we are here to show them how to run a state. Tomislav's crown belongs to us!"
 slv_blatnograd_title:0 "The City of Blatnograd"
 slv_blatnograd_desc:0 "Blatnograd, the most powerful and wealthy city of the Pannonians, cannot be neglected. Its importance in Danubian trade and commerce is of paramount concern to our realm. Empowering it would empower our new Pannonian subjects, securing not only their loyalty but also their wealth."
 slv_the_slavic_bridge_title:0 "Control the Slavic Bridge"
 slv_the_slavic_bridge_desc:0 "The basin on which the Pannonians sit is wealthy and fertile. However, it is also vulnerable— not only to us but also to roaming Magyars and ambitious Moravians. It is only a matter of time before it falls. We must act first and lay claim to this valuable land."
 slv_seize_dalmatia_title:0 "Dalmatian Trading Towns"
 slv_seize_dalmatia_desc:0 "Under Venetian hands, the coastal towns of the Adriatic have adopted Italian ways and become key components of a powerful trade network. The Croatians, now our loyal subjects, are rearing to reclaim these lands. We must heed their cries and launch an offensive now so that we may placate our newest subjects and render the Adriatic a possession of ours proper."
 slv_subjugate_the_serbs_title:0 "Subjugate the Serbs"
 slv_subjugate_the_serbs_desc:0 "With Croatia under our control, it is appropriate that we expand our Balkan frontier. Of all the peoples of the Balkans, the Serbs are a particularly aggressive force. Though they have struggled in recent years against their more powerful neighbours, their tenacity is admirable - fearsome, even. We must settle the score before they pose an existential threat."
 slv_end_bulgarias_hegemony_title:0 "End Bulgaria's Hegemony"
 slv_end_bulgarias_hegemony_desc:0 "For the past century, Bulgaria has ridden the ever-shifting wave of power in the Balkans with reckless might. With the eminent collapse of the Romans at hand, they have sought to establish themselves as a new hegemon of the Balkans. While preferable to the likes of the Magyars and the Venetians, it would be far more preferable for a Catholic power, such as us, to reign paramount. Bulgarian must fall!"
 slv_south_slavic_union_title:0 "South Slavic Union"
 slv_south_slavic_union_desc:0 "With the plethora of the Slavic peoples of the Balkans singing joyfully under our banners, it is only appropriate that we spearhead the efforts to unify them beneath a banner eternal, for all the centuries to come to remember. A union of the Southern Slavs - that is what we are!"
 slv_control_the_electors_title:0 "Influence the Electors"
 slv_control_the_electors_desc:0 "We would be foolish to neglect our ties to the Holy Roman Empire. Regrettably, it has been a safeguard at times— as a state on its frontier, we have been guarded by its various authorities and interchanging Emperors on numerous occasions. Now, with our ambitions becoming realised, we may sway the electors themselves to reconsider our previously meagre standing."
 slv_a_slavic_emperor_title:0 "A Slavic Emperor"
 slv_a_slavic_emperor_desc:0 "Having convinced a plethora of Holy Roman authorities, electors and stakeholders of our rising power, Emperorship is within reach. If we were to secure it, we would secure access to the empire's vast resources - bountiful taxation, diplomatic recognition, and military support. A Slavic emperorship is at hand!"
 slv_sway_the_germans_title:0 "Sway the Germans"
 slv_sway_the_germans_desc:0 "Adjacent to our holdings, the Germans have long since been a thorn in our side. On occasion, they have proven to be valuable allies - this can never be depended upon though, for the inclinations of the Styrians and the mechanisations of the Bavarians change as frequently as the weather. We must lay claim to German land proper and announce to these outsiders that we are not to be trifled with!"
 slv_carantanian_restoration_title:0 "Carantanian Restoration"
 slv_carantanian_restoration_desc:0 "Long ago, the fearsome Frankish merchant Samo led our people in defence against vicious outsiders - Franks, Avars and Moravians alike. Under his rule, Carantania was proclaimed and established. Ever since we have suffered at the hands of envious outsiders and been diminished in standing. No more! Carantania is rising anew and will not be stopped!"
 slv_end_the_habsburgs_title:0 "End the Habsburgs"
 slv_end_the_habsburgs_desc:0 "Deep in the mountains of Tirol, a hideous phenomenon lurks. Pointed chins, elongated jaws, protruding noses - a wicked family of perfidious conspirators, blighted by inbreeding and centuries of scheming. Some say they hold ambitions to lay claim to all of Austria proper, to wipe us under the rug of their ambitions and render Carpathia subservient. We must put an end to this nightmarish plan - drive these fools back into their mountain fortresses!"
 slv_teutonic_advance_title:0 "Teutonic Advance"
 slv_teutonic_advance_desc:0 "The Germans shall remember our name! Bavaria lies vulnerable and disunited. We must advance our western frontier and encroach upon these ancient forests and wizened peaks. Once our foothold is sufficient, the whole of the empire will have no choice but to acknowledge our rising power and the potential of our domination!"
 slv_rekindle_slavic_ties_title:0 "Rekindle the Slavic Ties"
 slv_rekindle_slavic_ties_desc:0 "Our ties to the Moravians, Pannonians and Slovaks cannot be ignored. Distant as they have become, they once fought with us beneath a single banner. We must rekindle our old ties with the greater Slavic world to the north and declare our intent to unify these squabbling peoples!"
 slv_restore_samos_empire_title:0 "Legacy of Samo"
 slv_restore_samos_empire_desc:0 "Great Samo's empire once stretched from the woods of Gorica to the plains of Silesia. The whole world has worked hard to forget this - but we shall remind them by reviving Samo's legacy, even improving upon it! Samo's Empire shall be reborn!"
 slv_princes_stone_title:0 "Inauguration at Prince's Stone"
 slv_princes_stone_desc:0 "For many centuries, our wise rulers have been inaugurated in the presence of the ancient Prince's Stone. Said to have been created in the times of Rome, the stone has been a vital rite of coronation and has bolstered the legitimacy of our royal line tenfold. This land is ours - the stone decrees it as such! The whole world must realise the error of its ways in trampling our ancient culture and attempting to snuff us out."
 slv_slovenian_prosperity_title:0 "Slovenian Prosperity"
 slv_slovenian_prosperity_desc:0 "As guarantor of the Slovenian people, our state must put their wellbeing first. Our lands have been curtailed, razed, pillaged and ransacked by barbaric outsiders time and time again until we have been reduced to a humble enclave. Never again! The Slovenian people must prosper, first and foremost."
 slv_resettle_ancestral_lands_title:0 "Resettle Ancestral Lands"
 slv_resettle_ancestral_lands_desc:0 "Long ago, our people laid claim to a vast extent of territory. Over the long and tiring centuries, Germans, Pannonians, Magyars, and the wicked Venetians have seen fit to reduce us, and if they continue to have their way, we will be wiped from the map completely. This change must be reversed— Slovenian song must flourish!"
 slv_economic_development_title:0 "Economic Development"

 slv_boost_the_production_desc:0 "Having renewed our economic efforts and expanded the extent of our power, we now stand in a stronger position. Our production stands to benefit. We must compete tenfold with our neighbours and become a powerhouse of production!"
 slv_restore_krnski_grad_title:0 "Rebuild Krnski Grad"
 slv_restore_krnski_grad_desc:0 "In ancient papers, Krnski Grad, in the humble province of Celovec, was described as an important seat of power and the original home of the Prince's Stone. Today, it is but a quiet wooded land - but with enough resources, it could once again be a place of majestic wealth and power. Krnski Grad must be rebuilt!"
 slv_embrace_industrialization_title:0 "Industrialize the Nation"

 slv_crossroads_title:0 "Crossroads of Trade"
 slv_crossroads_desc:0 "We stand at a crossroads of global trade. From the east, the wealth of the distant Silk Road flows, courtesy of the Crimean Steppe, the Black Sea and old Constantinople. From the south, the riches of the Adriatic glitter, flowing endlessly. To the north, the ebb and flow associated with the ancient Amber Road continues to flow, even to this day. We are at a vital point in Europe's trade network - we must exploit it!"
 slv_archdiocese_of_ljubljana_title:0 "Archdiocese of Ljubljana"
 slv_archdiocese_of_ljubljana_desc:0 "Good Christians we are, it is only appropriate that we pay respect to the Lord Almighty! Kranjska requires adequate resources devoted to its local clergy, as well as a mighty cathedral to draw the envy of the whole world! Furthermore, our good theologians deserve the influence and recognition they deserve for their holy efforts." 
 slv_answer_the_reformation_title:0 "Answer the Reformation"
 slv_answer_the_reformation_desc:0 "Chaos reigns. Divine uncertainty has plagued Europe in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.

 rmg_war_emilia_romagna_title:0 "War for Romagna"
 rmg_war_emilia_romagna_desc:0 "Romagna is one of the less prestigious princes of northern Italy, being situated between larger powers such as Lombardy, Venice, and Florence. In fact, Romagna's territory is quite limited. It would do us a great deal to consolidate power in our immediate region, claiming all of Emilia-Romagna for our own."
 rmg_romagnan_victory_title:0 "Romagnan Victory"
 rmg_romagnan_victory_desc:0 "The Emilia-Romagna region is rich in opportune territory and resources. Bringing this area into our direct control will lead to much needed prosperity and power. By uniting the Romagnols and creating a power base in this region, we can proclaim our victory and stake a legitimate claim on our neighbors."
 rmg_develop_ferrara_title:0 "Estuary of the Po"
 rmg_develop_ferrara_desc:0 "Our capital city of Ferrara's position on the Po river is beyond advantageous. Situated at the mouth of its waters opening into the Adriatic Sea, the city could be easily constructed to further exploit this area. Therefore, we must build up the city, developing its lands and infrastructure to better squeeze wealth out of the Po river and its various activities."
 rmg_curtail_nobles_title:0 "Supremacy of the Crown"
 rmg_curtail_nobles_desc:0 "Monarchism in practice is not always subject to absolute power. In fact, it is no secret that the estates of Romagna have considerable influence over the country and its policy. This system, while opportune at times, has a habit of getting in the way of the king's necessary mandates. Therefore, in order to ensure an efficient system, we must assert the crown's supremacy and ensure that these estates are curtailed under its authority."
 rmg_cuisine_title:0 "Italian Cuisine"
 rmg_cuisine_desc:0 "If there is one thing that Italy is known for, it is its food. For centuries, esteemed culinary masterminds have littered the continent, creating incredible recipes revered throughout every land. Many will pay a pretty penny for these dishes, and the industry is not insubstantial within Italian lands. With the right encouragement, infrastructure, and support, we could expand this industry even further, improving the Italian economy for the foreseeable future."
 rmg_conquer_florence_title:0 "Conquer Florence"
 rmg_conquer_florence_desc:0 "One of the first enemies to destroy on our path to Italian dominance is the state of Florence.

 rmg_florence_monument_title:0 "Expand the Cathedral"
 rmg_florence_monument_desc:0 "The Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore or the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower is an important Italian landmark and apparent mark of impressive Italian architecture and engineering. It would be incredibly advantageous to improve this building. Therefore, let us expand it, increasing our prestige, elevating our status as a nation, and creating a nice example for our faithful subjects"
 rmg_build_shipyards_title:0 "Flotta Mediterranea"
 rmg_build_shipyards_desc:0 "From the times of the Romans, Italian dominance over the Mediterranean has never been a question. Any Italian state would do no good to be weak on its waves. It is crucial, then, that we build a grand galley fleet and expand our shipbuilding industry to spread our influence over the waters. With these things done, our new Mediterranean fleet can begin the process of dominating its waves."
 rmg_invade_genoa_title:0 "Invade Genoa"
 rmg_invade_genoa_desc:0 "The Genoese have had dominance of the Ligurian Sea for much too long. Their emphasis on trade and profitable government have drained the region dry for anyone but themselves. It is of utmost importance, then, that we take over this treacherous state and seize the trade for ourselves. Not only could it be profitable for our nation, but it could restore health to the region available only by our stewardship."
 rmg_unite_italy_title:0 "Nation of Italy"
 rmg_unite_italy_desc:0 "As we continue to grow in our conquests, a curious proposal has come to our table: What is our nation's destiny? With so many Italian lands under our control, is it not appropriate to turn our eyes to something bigger? We must do so immediately, for Italy is a rich and prestigious land, much like our nation. If its lands are ours, we must claim its mantle. We are not Romangan, we are Italian! "
 rmg_retake_isles_title:0 "Secure the Isles"
 rmg_retake_isles_desc:0 "To our West, Italy stretches beyond its boot. The Italian isles of Sardinia and Corsica lay under the influence of foreign powers. Valuable as military bases and trade hubs in their own right, it is past time to unite these islands with their home country. We must remind them of their Italian roots."
 rmg_no_muslim_title:0 "End the Sultanate"
 rmg_no_muslim_desc:0 "We have pushed the Sicilians back, removing them from the isles and the immediate south, but as long as any remnant remains on Italian isles, our peoples are not safe. Let us not just drive these evildoers out but eliminate them entirely, ending their threat once and for all."
 rmg_liberate_naples_title:0 "Italian Crusade"
 rmg_liberate_naples_desc:0 "The Muslim threat to the South is incredibly real and incredibly dangerous. These peoples do not belong among the good Christian peoples of Italy, and they must be driven out at all costs. The land of Napoli and beyond require a strong faithful hand to guide them, and it is long past time these muslim invaders taste the sword."
 rmg_romagnol_renaissance_title:0 "Romagnol Renaissance"

From incredible urban projects and works of art to the simple sprawl of metropolitan areas, Italian prowess in this area is unmatched. Let us continue this skill, then, and build churches and universities to continue the urbanization of our many rich lands."
 rmg_wonders_of_italy_title:0 "Wonders of Italy"
 rmg_wonders_of_italy_desc:0 "While simple buildings can do a lot for our prosperity, it is not these projects that elevate Italians to such prestige. No - these are our great works of art: projects so substantial and beautiful their very presence evokes awe in any that walk past. We must steward these important landmarks, then, improving their beauty to every degree possible."
 rmg_question_of_roma_title:0 "The Question of Roma"
 rmg_question_of_roma_desc:0 "Roma, the old capital of the Roman Empire and the papacy, is highly regarded as one of the most important cities in the world, and its importance to our state is no different. Roma must be in Italian hands for our legitimacy to be valid, yet if there is no Papal State, surely the Catholic world will turn on us immediately. We must decide what to do with this important city, but through conquest or subjugation, it will be under our control."
 rmg_develop_naples_title:0 "Develop the South"
 rmg_develop_naples_desc:0 "After the tragic treatment of our peoples under the Sicilians, Southern Italy has been isolated and ravaged from true Italian rule. Therefore, we must build up these areas, investing in their development and continued prosperity."
 rmg_urbanize_italy_title:0 "Urbanize Italy"
 rmg_urbanize_italy_desc:0 "Italy has been a region of cities for centuries. While many farmlands and mountains lie along its territories, the real riches lie within the advancements gained from cities and populated areas. With this in mind, we should endeavor to improve these areas and urbanize them wherever we can. We can support a greater population, encourage economic riches, and improve the country itself as we do."
 rmg_industrial_powerhouse_title:0 "Industrial Powerhouse"
 rmg_industrial_powerhouse_desc:0 "While trade is vital in any economy, production is arguably just as important. In order to continue competing with the many nations of Europe and beyond, we must ensure our production is up to speed, constructing numerous manufactories to support its expansion and ensuring immense economic power."
 rmg_end_venice_title:0 "Adriatic Domination"
 rmg_end_venice_desc:0 "The Adriatic Sea, full of wealth and land opportunities, has been under the control of Venice for a long time. Whether the state itself or any that controls Venetia, the region is undoubtedly the power base for any with an interest in those waters. No longer. By conquest or naval dominance, we must ensure that we face no threat on these waters and let no other country have dominance."
 rmg_dalmatia_title:0 "Rein In Dalmatia"
 rmg_dalmatia_desc:0 "Dalmatia is in a unique situation in relation to Italy. The Dalmatian peoples, while not connected to the mainland, are undoubtedly Latin peoples. This, then, also creates an opportunity. If we could seize this land and develop it, we could open up invaluable opportunities for trade and use it as a jumping-off point for future conquests."
 rmg_slovenia_title:0 "The Gate of Balkans"
 rmg_slovenia_desc:0 "The Balkans have been linked to Italian ambitions for a great deal of time, and why not? The lands are rich in trade, conquest, and Mediterranean dominance. Our interests must be aligned with theirs, and by conquering the region of Carniola, we can open the gates to further goals onwards."
 rmg_croatia_title:0 "Subjugate Croatia"
 rmg_croatia_desc:0 "Croatia is a nation of strength and controls a large swath of lands in the Balkans. It would do us a great service to bring them under our heel. After all, these peoples are not too dissimilar from the Italians, and their key lands would fit nicely within our growing nation."
 rmg_unite_latin_title:0 "Complete the Risorgimento"
 rmg_unite_latin_desc:0 "Upon claiming the mantle of Italy, it became increasingly clear that the completion of 'Italy' was not fully complete. As long as any Latin peoples lie outside of our control, Italy continues to be disunited. This must be rectified. The Risorgimento must be complete. Italy will be united!"
 rmg_mare_nostrum_title:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 rmg_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "While the Roman Empire fell centuries ago, we have not forgotten its legacy. From East to West, they completely controlled the Mediterranean, and while they may have fallen to the annals of history, there is no reason that the Italian peoples should be withheld its legacy. If not by conquest, by sheer military might we must dominate these waters. Let us build a fleet the likes of which no Mediterranean nation has ever seen, asserting our claim to the sea indefinitely."
 rmg_scout_army_title:0 "Reggimenti Ricognizio"
 rmg_scout_army_desc:0 "Cavalry units are useful for many things, including their fighting power and special prowess for flanking, but they are also useful for reconnaissance, and their presence in any army of ours is vital. Let us hire many regiments to participate on the battlefield and ensure their effectiveness there."
 rmg_into_po_valley_title:0 "Into the Po Valley"
 rmg_into_po_valley_desc:0 "Having control of the end of the Po River gives us many opportunities, yet our control is by no means final. The lands to the north also benefit immensely from its prosperity. These lands should be ours. Therefore, let us seize them for ourselves, bringing the whole of the Po Valley under our control and opening avenues to the north and east."
 rmg_serbia_title:0 "Rule the Serbs"
 rmg_serbia_desc:0 "As we continue our Balkan conquests, our next target comes to be Serbia, a collection of arguably Slavic peoples, but important ones nonetheless. Let us conquer them swiftly, placing them securely under our rule and pushing past the limits of Croatia to seek further expansion."
 rmg_bulgaria_title:0 "Conquest of Balkans"
 rmg_bulgaria_desc:0 "With our conquest of Serbia, we have split open the Balkans to our influence. They lay in wait for our influence to sweep into the region and place them strategically under our graceful rule. Let us finish this endeavor, finally sweeping these lands under our flag."
 rmg_northern_prosperity_title:0 "Northern Prosperity"
 rmg_northern_prosperity_desc:0 "Northern Italy is, by all margins, our home, and a rich one at that. If we are to continue our economic progress, we must exploit this region and create buildings and infrastructure to aid its elevated status in our nation."
 rmg_cannons_of_mantova_title:0 "Cannons of Mantova"
 rmg_cannons_of_mantova_desc:0 "The newest advance in military technology relies on superior firepower - the presence of cannons. Luckily for us, one of our provinces - Mantova - seems to have an affinity for making them, and doing it well. We should support this endeavor and ensure Mantova has all the resources it needs to make quality cannons for our army. Surely, it will be beneficial for us in the long run."
 rmg_italian_warfare_title:0 "Italian Warfare"
 rmg_italian_warfare_desc:0 "What’s to define the Italian army? Discipline? Size? Professionalism or sheer might? All of these things! We must ensure our army is rich in all of these things and one to be feared throughout Europe and the whole world at large."
 rmg_unite_north_title:0 "Unite the North"
 rmg_unite_north_desc:0 "The Northern Italian provinces have been nothing but trouble to the Romangnan nation. It is no question that in Lombardy sits the most legitimacy towards an Italian state, and those that lie there continually threaten our state's existence. Let us end this feud once and for all and finally bring these vitally important lands under our banner."
 rmg_fortify_alps_title:0 "Fortify Our Flank"
 rmg_fortify_alps_desc:0 "Northern Italy is in a unique geographic position in accordance with the rest of Europe. While many European countries are vulnerable to invasion and threat from any angle, the Alps create a unique opportunity for our defense, shielding us from virtually any attempted crossing of them. We must exploit this fact, constructing effective fortifications to our North and West where any would dare to cross into the heart of our country."
 rmg_greece_title:0 "Cross the Pindus"
 rmg_greece_desc:0 "Another important part of the Italian legacy is its dominance over the nation of Greece. The Romans conquered this region quite early on, and it quickly became a core part of its territory. Since then, Italian and Greek desires have been invariably linked. We must cross the Pindus, then, reining in the Greek lands for our own and enforcing our subjugation in the current age."
 rmg_latin_empire_title:0 "City of the World's Desire"
 rmg_latin_empire_desc:0 "While the East and West Roman Empires controlled vast swaths of territory, their regions can really be boiled down to the control of two crucial cities: Rome and Constantinople. Each city is a region of immense cultural and religious significance. With our recent conquests in Greece, we finally have an opportunity to reach Constantinople - the city of the world's desire - so let us launch an attack on it, reuniting East and West."
 rmg_jerusalem_title:0 "Protector of the Holy Land"
 rmg_jerusalem_desc:0 "The Holy Land of Jerusalem was where our Lord and Savior came to save the world from its sin, and by no means can we let these lands fall under any nefarious hands. Therefore, we must ensure that we are the protectors of these lands, for the benefit of its people, and the benefit of our savior above."
 rmg_balkan_metropolises_title:0 "Balkan Metropolises"
 rmg_balkan_metropolises_desc:0 "The Balkans are a large region known for its many cities. In fact, it is where a significant portion of its economic opportunity comes from. As controllers of a large part of this region, we must ensure that these metropolises experience unparalleled prosperity, building them up to their full potential and the advantage of our nation."
 rmg_romeo_juliet_title:0 "Romeo and Juliet"
 rmg_romeo_juliet_desc:0 "Many might know the city of Verona as the setting for Shakespeare’s famous ‘Romeo and Juliet’, but Verona is so much more than that. After all, why would Shakespeare choose such a city for his play? The answer is simple: the city is magnificent, and has so much potential to become much more. As the capital of our state, it is our job to expand it even more, ranking Verona among cities such as Rome, London, or Paris."
 rmg_veronese_victory_title:0 "Veronese Victory"
 rmg_veronese_victory_desc:0 "The Emilia-Romagna region is rich in opportune territory and resources. Bringing this area into our direct control will lead to much needed prosperity and power. By uniting the Romagnols and creating a power base in this region, we can proclaim our victory and stake a legitimate claim on our neighbors."
 rmg_police_state_title:0 "A Police State"
 rmg_police_state_desc:0 "How does one control a populace? We elect to do so by strictness. Our state would be much more efficient if our people denied frivolity and got back to work. We must create our police state to remedy their actions, cracking down on them and establishing our absolute power over the state. Only then can we ensure absolute efficiency and loyalty for the ages to come."
 rmg_burghers_rule_title:0 "Burghers Rule"
 rmg_burghers_rule_desc:0 "Balancing the estates of our country has proven difficult, with many powers shifting between prominence and ownership of crownland, yet there is undoubtedly one estate that must be elevated above all others: the burghers. Therefore, let us establish mercantile dominance over the court and secure a power base for them to work from, supporting their endeavors"
 rmg_parman_victory_title:0 "Parman Victory"
 rmg_parman_victory_desc:0 "The Emilia-Romagna region is rich in opportune territory and resources. Bringing this area into our direct control will lead to much needed prosperity and power. By uniting the Romagnols and creating a power base in this region, we can proclaim our victory and stake a legitimate claim on our neighbors."
 rmg_gem_of_italy_title:0 "Gem of Italy"
 rmg_gem_of_italy_desc:0 "Parma has fallen quite under the radar of history until now, settled quietly among larger powers such as Lombardy. We’d like to think of this in a different way. Parma is not insignificant, but a hidden gem, and its potential for improvement is large if we are to put effort into it. Let us encourage more development in our nation’s capital and raise it above those cities which would count themselves as ‘better’ than ours."
 rmg_share_power_title:0 "Share of Power"
 rmg_share_power_desc:0 "The estates of our country have long been in imbalance and constantly bickering with each other, causing a status of disorder within the court, yet their usefulness can not be understated. Each one has something to benefit the state, and their positions are invaluable. Therefore, we should continue to appease them, keeping a delicate balance between the estates, with the crown at the center. This way, we can reap the rewards while preventing a power struggle among them."
 rmg_lion_of_parma_title:0 "The Lion of Parma"
 rmg_lion_of_parma_desc:0 "Legends tell of Parma’s emergence onto the world’s scene. It seems inevitable, upon further thought. Diviners and priests whisper prophecies under their breath, crazed men shouting nonsense on the streets, yet what is their common thread? These legends speak of lions, the embodiment of Parma into the future - a dominant power called Parmelion upon Europe and the whole world. If we can bring about this future, can we truly take a hold on it? Can we become the Parma Lion?"
 rmg_ravennan_victory_title:0 "Ravennan Victory"
 rmg_ravennan_victory_desc:0 "The Emilia-Romagna region is rich in opportune territory and resources. Bringing this area into our direct control will lead to much needed prosperity and power. By uniting the Romagnols and creating a power base in this region, we can proclaim our victory and stake a legitimate claim on our neighbors."
 rmg_capital_of_west_rome_title:0 "Capital of West Rome"
 rmg_capital_of_west_rome_desc:0 "Long ago, Ravenna stood as a city rivaling the importance of even Roma itself. As the capital of West Rome, it thrived, yet as the ages passed, this fact disappeared into the annals of history. No longer! We must restore this city to its former glory and establish once more its dominance over Italy and beyond."
 rmg_clergy_rule_title:0 "Clergy Rule"
 rmg_clergy_rule_desc:0 "Balancing the estates of our country has proven difficult, with many powers shifting between prominence and ownership of crownland, yet there is undoubtedly one estate that must be elevated above all others: the clergy. Therefore, let us establish clerical dominance over the court and secure a power base for them to work from, supporting their endeavors."
 rmg_legacy_of_west_rome_title:0 "Heir of West Rome"
 rmg_legacy_of_west_rome_desc:0 "Ravenna is much more than the former capital of West Rome itself. No, instead, we are its true successors. Many pretenders lie on our borders, not limited to the Byzantine threat around the Aegean, yet if we are to destroy them and establish our legitimate claim to the Roman throne, the mantle of West Rome is undoubtedly within our reach."

 #Events
 ab_tuscany.1.t:0 "The Tyranny of the Medici"
 ab_tuscany.1.d:0 "For the past two decades, the Medici have been scheming to take power for themselves within the nascant Florentine Republic. In the last election within the Signoria, they planned to elect a member of the di Calimala guild as the next Gonfaloniere, but due to the influence of Pope Eugenius IV, who had received a generous donation from the Medici family, enough votes were swayed with papal pressure to elect Cosimo de'Medici to the position. Afterward, it was said the he had planned to implement a series of reforms  to make a new form of dictatorship, with the hope of consolidating power for the Medici. This rumor, true or false, enraged both the guilds and the common folk of the city, who, in an act of frustration and rage, launched a series of violent protests in the streets of the ancient city. An emergency sessions of the Signoria was called in order to solve this matter, with all manner of folk attending."
 ab_tuscany.1.a:0 "The trade guilds vote to oust the Medici. The Cerchi have taken over!"
 ab_tuscany.1.b:0 "A general by the name Frederico Bianchi launched a coup d'etat with his mercenary army!"
 ab_tuscany.1.c:0 "A peasant mob, led by Ronaldo di Ferenze, stormed the meeting!"
 ab_tuscany.1.e:0 "The Medici arrest the mob, bribe the council, and enforce their rule!"
 ab_tuscany.2.t:0 "The Restoration of the Mantua Commune"
 ab_tuscany.2.d:0 "While the commune was a beautiful dream in the 12th Century, it was conquered and subjugated by the might of the mercenaries of Verona, and the hope of a peasant republic in the heart of the Po Valley was crushed. Now, Gonfaloniere [Root.Monarch.GetName] has made it a mission to restore the ancient city to its former glory, and even continue the construction of the famous Basilica di Sant'Andrea, of which much work remains to be completed. With our armies circulating the city, it shall remain untouched by roaving barbarians and fiendish rogue vagabonds. The city holds its elections in peace now, and it is a lovely time."
 ab_tuscany.2.a:0 "I hope they elect another poet!"
 ab_tuscany.3.t:0 "The Theft of the Mona Lisa"
 ab_tuscany.3.d:0 "The Mona Lisa is a prized artifact of Tuscan creation. However, when the province of [mona_lia_province.GetName] fell to invading forces, our soldiers found this immaculate piece of art hanging in the halls of a wealthy art collector. They were so in awe of its impressive craftsmanship that they gently took it from its pedastol and brought it back as a prize for our nation. While many decry this as theft, we see it more as...ensurance, taking it to a people that are more fit to protect it."
 ab_tuscany.3.a:0 "One man's treasure is another man's...treasure."
 ab_tuscany.4.t:0 "The Mona Lisa Stolen"
 ab_tuscany.4.d:0 "The Mona Lisa is a prized artifact of Tuscan creation, and due to our inability to protect its home province, it was stolen!"
 ab_tuscany.4.a:0 "An issue of skill, it seems."
 ab_tuscany.5.t:0 "Peasant's Revolution"
 ab_tuscany.5.d:0 "Influence from the Tuscan Peasant's republic has inspired peasants within our nation to rise up against us. While we have attempted to keep them suppressed, they gain support and influence from foreign powers, and it has caused them to attempt a revolution within our own state!"
 ab_tuscany.5.a:0 "Ungrateful Rabble!"
 ab_tuscany.6.t:0 "To Tempt the Vicar of Christ"
 ab_tuscany.6.d:0 "The Bishop of Rome is the most influential person in all of Europe. With a word from his lips, great armies sally forth into the lands of the heathen and heretic alike. In Italy, the Pope has more than just spiritual influence and political sway, he has actual lands that he commands, with levies and soldiers at his grasp. We have careful ingratiated ourselves within his most powerful bishoprics, and have worked to ensure that the good pontiff is our most trusted ally. A few gifts to  here, a few trips to the vinyards there, and even a few donations of our most prized architects to construct their great cathedrals and churches. All in the hopes of this moment - to get the Pope under our control."
 ab_tuscany.6.a:0 "I want [PAP.Monarch.GetName] at my beck and call!"
 ab_tuscany.6.b:0 "A simple alliance will do."
 ab_tuscany.7.t:0 "The Fate of the Holy City"
 ab_tuscany.7.d:0 "The most holy city of Rome has been under [118.Owner.GetAdjective] for quite some time now. A question of ownership has been raised by the signora, as it would be an excellent spot for a capital of the Italian Federation. However, taking the city could cause our sister republic to be truly enraged. We must think carefuly about what we wish to do regarding the city."
 ab_tuscany.7.a:0 "We shall take it for ourselves!"
 ab_tuscany.7.b:0 "It shall remain in the hands of the [118.Owner.GetAdjective]"
 ab_tuscany.8.t:0 "The Liberation of Naples"
 ab_tuscany.8.d:0 "For far too long, the people of southern Italy have been underneath the control of the Sicilian emirate. God fearing Christians have been suffering as tax after tax has been levied upon them, all the while the heathens ruling them harrass and enforce conversion on those who refuse to pay their tyranical payments. When we arrived in the great towns of Napoli, Salerno, and Taranto, we were greeted with cheers and church bells ringing; they have been freed from the oppressive yolk of the Sicilians! Having liberated their cities through the might of our federation, a question has been raised about how we are to organize these great lands underneath our control. How should we organize these new lands?"
 ab_tuscany.8.a:0 "Liberate each region as their own state."
 ab_tuscany.8.b:0 "Unite them under a single banner."
 ab_tuscany.8.c:0 "They shall live under our watchful eye."
 ab_tuscany.9.t:0 "Restoration of Trinacria"
 ab_tuscany.9.d:0 "The ancient isle of Sicily, or as it was known before the Muslim invasion, Trinacria, was once a hub of Christian learning and scholarship, but the domination of the Shiite has developed a new and unique culture. A mixture of Arab, Norman, Neapolitan, and foreign Italian merchants have combined to make this island a bustling hub of unique ideas and traditions. We do not wish to remove this new identity, we merely wish to emphasize the Christian heritage of the isle, and to restore Trinacria to its rightful place at the center of Italian learning."
 ab_tuscany.9.a:0 "Let us transform Sicily into Trinacria!"
 ab_tuscany.9.b:0 "Let us restore the lands of Trinacria!"

 tus_renaissance_city_title: "City of the Renaissance"
 tus_renaissance_city_desc: "As the most populous city in Christian Italy, Firenze houses the greatest opportunities for those who seek new ventures. With the imminent crisis of the crumbling Byzantines, their great philosophical schools have been seeking more peaceful lands that will allow them to commit to their musings. With only a short hop across the Adriatic, the majority have found themselves in our flourishing capital, and we welcome them with open arms."
 tus_great_tuscan_works_title: "The Great Tuscan Works"
 tus_great_tuscan_works_desc:0 "One of the symbols of great Tuscan prosperity is the magnificence of our great works: the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Santa Maria del Fiore. They are the combined effort of both creative individuals who blended Gothic and Romanesque styles while ensuring the architecture is not completely conspicuous as well as the committed people who dedicated their lives, over several generations, to complete the works. As a result, all Europeans who consider themselves of an artistic bent first seek to see the Tuscan great works before embarking on their own visionary designs."
 tus_tuscan_cities_title: "The Golden Age of Guilds"
 tus_tuscan_cities_desc:0 "As Italy was fractured, each Signoria attempted to outdo every other, concentrating all their resources into building the most opulent cities. Ultimately this was a futile endeavour, as we alone ascended into supremacy over Tuscany. Now we have total control over the most developed cities in Europe, with a well-developed infrastructure programme funded by the guilds. As a result, Tuscany is in a golden age in all but name."
 tus_fortify_position_title: "Fortify Our Republic"
 tus_fortify_position_desc:0 "With the failure of the Italian coalition to neuter the Sicilian threat emerging from the south, the Italian states lying just north of the Emirate are now pincered between the devil and the deep blue sea. With the Carolingian emperors paralysed in a crisis of their own making, we are on our own, and must fortify and defend the republic."
 tus_unite_tuscany_title: "The Tuscan Destiny"
 tus_unite_tuscany_desc:0 "Without a doubt, we need to unify the Tuscan people. With uncertain times ahead, we are lone trees standing tall amongst the winds of change. The time for petty squabbles between Tuscans has passed, and as threats encroach from all sides, it is foolish to remain divided."

 tus_conquer_romagna_title: "Conquest of Romagna"
 tus_conquer_romagna_desc:0 "The Romagnan states are of little value or importance to the advancement of Italian interests – they are merely high-quality lands for produce and raising cattle. If anything, they are a buffer zone that protects the northern kingdoms of Lombardy and Venice from us. As the mere roadblocks they are, it is time to remove them and push them to aside the Via Flaminia."
 tus_the_po_valley_title: "La Liga Padana"
 tus_the_po_valley_desc:0 "The Northern Commune was a short-lived dream in the 12th century, crushed at the hands of mercenaries, and the hope of a peasant republic in the heart of the Po Valley was stamped out. With renewed strength, Gonfaloniere [Root.Monarch.GetName] has made it his mission to restore the ancient city of Mantua to its former glory, and even continue the construction of the famous Basilica di Sant'Andrea. Without the oversight of the Emperor, all are free to take advantage of the chaos, and we are no exception."
 tus_liguria_conquest_title: "Secure the Western Coasts"
 tus_liguria_conquest_desc:0 "The Apennine Mountains serve as a natural and impenetrable defense against invaders seeking to cross to the other side. Thus, the only remaining threats are those with whom we share control of the western flank of the mountains. Controlling the Ligurian coast will consolidate our defenses and secure our control of trade in the Ligurian Sea."
 tus_defeat_venice_title: "Defeat the Doge"
 tus_defeat_venice_desc:0 "The Venetian Doges of past have always set their sights further than the Italian peninsula, arrogantly believing themselves to be above the business of the average Italian citizen. Without our people's squabbling nature, they would never have taken control of the major ports in the Adriatic. It is time to put them in their place—beneath the tides, since they seem to love the sea so much!"
 tus_iron_crown_lombardy_title: "The Iron Crown"
 tus_iron_crown_lombardy_desc:0 "The Iron Crown: a pitiful symbol of European monarchist wealth and opulence, overemphasised as being the key to Lombard control. Frankish rule over Lombardy was thrown aside for Visconti control, and in token fashion the Iron Crown was passed on too. The Iron Crown has long lost its meaning, and we will crush it beneath the feet of a thousand peasants!"
 tus_piedmont_seizure_title: "The Alpine Campaign"
 tus_piedmont_seizure_desc:0 "The Piedmontese control the Alpine pass, a key crossroad in Imperial trade, ensuring that they retain friendly relations with all states who engage in inter-regional trade. By taking control of the pass for ourselves, one way or another, trade will naturally flow into our hands and enrich the peasant cause."
 tus_dream_of_italia_title: "Dream of Italia"
 tus_dream_of_italia_desc:0 "The rebirth of Italy is not merely a political ambition; it is a cultural renaissance of unparalleled proportions. The very essence of Italian identity is infused with a profound appreciation for the Roman legacy. A symphony of artistic expression, intellectual curiosity, and architectural marvels, the Italian dream enamours both our citizens and the Mediterranean world at large. With a revival of our fortunes, the tapestry of Italian culture will once again find itself interwoven with the threads of its Roman ancestry. The land is a living testament to the resilience of a people who, against all odds, can triumph over division and rekindle the flames of their shared heritage. The Italian Commune, so much like the first republic and yet so different, will stand as a testament to this dormant potential, if we can only take the final step."
 tus_connect_cities_title: "Connect the Cities"
 tus_connect_cities_desc:0 "The Italian peninsula, as the main seat of Roman power, was home to the most extensive network of their roads. While most roadways have significantly deteriorated, the old foundations can allow for easy refurbishment. Connecting our cities is only a matter of time and investment, and the benefits will come swiftly after."
 tus_develop_countryside_title: "Revitalise the Countryside"
 tus_develop_countryside_desc:0 "With the Tuscan domain ever expanding, so must the size of our military to protect the borders. To support such an expanding military, we will need to grow the industries that support not only the war machine, but also the families of these loyal soldiers and their hometowns. Developing new industries and countryside farming lands is key to a stable future."
 tus_renaissance_men_title: "Renaissance Men"
 tus_renaissance_men_desc:0 "With the Renaissance era swiftly sweeping throughout Europe, the artistic legacy of Tuscany has ensured no end of like-minded, creative individuals willing to join the republic and chair important positions. We welcome all these Renaissance men and women with welcome arms!"
 tus_mona_lisa_commission_title: "Commission the Mona Lisa"
 tus_mona_lisa_commission_desc:0 "Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, contemporary of Andrea del Verrocchio, has recently established himself as one of the brightest and most creative individuals known to history. Having been active as a draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptist and architect, the genius polymath is perhaps best known for his incredible artworks. The definition of High Renaissance humanism, da Vinci has created many works of critical acclaim, and is eager to find the perfect artwork – his magnum opus."
 tus_minors_first_title:0 "Secure Foreign Support"
 tus_minors_first_desc:0 "With the collapse of the Medici family rule in Firenze, the newly proclaimed peasant state has started to militarise in order to spread their ideological beliefs throughout Italy. If we are to combat this rising menace, we will need to gain support from outside the region, as the Florentine state has significantly more resources than we do."
 tus_minors_second_title:0 "Surpass Florence"
 tus_minors_second_desc:0 "Firenze is one of the most populous and prosperous cities in Europe by far, and most cities cannot hope to match its continuous growth. By surmounting the prosperity and wealth of their golden city, we will show the Mediterranean that our capital is a more lucrative option than the city now run by peasants."
 tus_florence_challenge_hegemony_title: "Challenge the Hegemony"
 tus_florence_challenge_hegemony_desc:0 "The status quo in Europe needs a shake-up. With the indulgent monarchies wasting money on vanity projects to project their so-called 'affluence', there are few funds left to devote to developing the lands for their lowest – yet most important – people. As our strength accumulates and our cause to empower the peasants gathers unassailable momentum, the cowardly rulers hiding in their golden palaces have deemed us as an existential threat. The hegemony of the European powers is over, and the peasants shall take charge henceforth!"
 tus_florence_peasants_stable_title: "Stabilise the Peasants' State"
 tus_florence_peasants_stable_desc:0 "The civil unrest following the overthrowing of regional monarchs in Italy at our hand can spiral into disastrous consequences in the future. To ensure the stability of our peasant unions, we will need to devote the near future to improving our standing amongst the republican idealists such that they can follow our lead."
 tus_florence_guild_stable_title: "The Devil You Know..."
 tus_florence_guild_stable_desc:0 "The Tuscan Guild Signoria has been a long-established cornerstone of Florentine rule; without their support, the republic struggled to prosper, and now they hold incredible strength, even under our new commune. Although they go against the heart of what we stand for, it is better to make a deal with the devil you know, than the ones that hide in the shadows..."
 tus_florence_banking_masters_title: "Masters of the Banks"
 tus_florence_banking_masters_desc:0 "The Medici family established a lasting legacy in the Firenze banking system as the largest and most respected bank in Europe. Their wealth transcended monetary value and extended its hands into politics, the arts, and land ownership. Though they no longer rule the Florentine Republic, their employees still remain in the high positions commanded by Cosimo, and with so much invested in them, these individuals are willing to work with us to further Tuscan interests."
 tus_florence_mercenary_stable_title: "The Strong Guiding Hand"
 tus_florence_mercenary_stable_desc:0 "Italy, positioned in the centre of Europe and the heartland of its cultural epochs, stands as the strong guiding hand in shaping the history of the continent. The mercernary companies that are based in rich signorias like the Venetians and Genoans are much more focused on overseas ventures, while our mercenaries serve as honourable forces against superior foes. In this respect, they have garnered a solid reputation for themselves as one of the best representations of the Tuscan people."
 tus_florence_mercenary_expansion_title: "The Might of the Republic"
 tus_florence_mercenary_expansion_desc:0 "As our sights grow beyond the Apennine Mountains, we will need an adequate amount of men in order to establish the might of our republic. Whether they are mercenary corps or men directly employed by the state, we will need to surpass even the best armies in Europe in order to do what is needed!"
 tus_papal_influencing_title: "Swaying the Papacy"
 tus_papal_influencing_desc:0 "The Papacy has always been concerned with the preservation of their existence and their own importance. With the shadow of Sicily looming over St. Peter's Basilica, their usual attention to collecting indulgences from sinful monarchs has turned to dealing with the Muslim threat. As of now, we are finally in a position to ensure the Papacy and the Curia defer to us in more important matters."
 tus_defense_of_tuscany_title: "Defence of [Root.GetName]"
 tus_defense_of_tuscany_desc:0 "With every monarch in Europe eyeing up our Italian land, deeming our peasant republic a threat to European peace, we will need to heavily invest in defensive military structures and organisation in order to ward off those who seek easy pickings. We are more than peasants; we are a united force able to match anyone!"
 tus_the_italian_wars_title: "The Italian Wars"
 tus_the_italian_wars_desc:0 "War has come to Italy. These are not the 'civilised' skirmishes the Italians are accustomed to, but war as practised by the battle-hardened armies that participated in the largest wars in Europe. The sound of church bells and haggling merchants will soon be replaced by the gruesome, destructive cacophony of cannonfire. For the Tuscans and the Lombards, the horrors of war offer financial opportunity: the number of condottieri generals offering themselves to the highest bidder has risen dramatically, and there is no shortage of veteran soldiers willing to join these mercenary armies."
 tus_modernize_mercenaries_title: "Modernise the Military"
 tus_modernize_mercenaries_desc:0 "Without the unanimous support of the local mercenary groups in Tuscany, the republic would never have achieved the exponential growth it did in the 15th century. Now, it is time to reward these mercenaries by providing them direct employ, and to modernise our military to incorporate all kinds of armed forces."
 tus_conquer_the_pope_title: "Subjugate the Papacy"
 tus_conquer_the_pope_desc:0 "The Papal States have been a constant thorn in our side. With more than merely a theological agenda, the popes have constantly positioned themselves against us in many a matter in Italian conferences, if only to limit our so-called 'threat' against them. If they fear us so much, perhaps we should show them they were right all along!"
 tus_funding_ingenuity_title: "Italian Ingenuity"
 tus_funding_ingenuity_desc:0 "Being the heart of Italian culture is no easy feat. With our learned people and well-reputed institutions to fund their ingenuity, there is rarely a time when a revolutionary and innovative idea is not in the air. Most may not be useful, but it is the diamond in the rough, not the polished gem in the market stall, that we seek to find."
 tus_claim_neapolitan_lands_title: "Liberate the South"
 tus_claim_neapolitan_lands_desc:0 "With the collapse of Norman rule in southern Italy, the Sicilians struck swiftly and absorbed the fledgling states that emerged from their fall. Despite our best attempts at a coalition, typical Italian disagreements led to an embarassing defeat at Amalfi against the Sicilian phalanx, and resistance in the south quickly died. This time, we know not to bother asking the others for assistance – we can and will do it ourselves!"
 tus_rule_from_rome_title: "Revitalise Rome"
 tus_rule_from_rome_desc:0 "Roma has always been the heart of Italy and the centrepoint for the largest contiguous empire known to Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The cultural legacy that has withstood the millennia that have since passed is strongest here, and the generations of families that lived here have longed to see that day again. Let us revitalise Rome, and return the heart of Europe to the glory it shall always be remembered for!"
 tus_industrialization_of_tuscany_title: "Industry of Tuscany"
 tus_industrialization_of_tuscany_desc:0 "With the advent of global trade as a result of European colonialism spreading across the entire world, supply has never been lower than before, and demand never higher. Many high-quality textiles, artistic ceramics, and glasswares in particular have multiplied in price, leaving greedy merchants to exploit gaps in the market for their own profit. Tuscany must ensure that they are not the only ones to benefit from this!"
 tus_tuscan_metropole_title: "The Metropole of Italy"
 tus_tuscan_metropole_desc:0 "With the advent of the printing press and new goods from the New World, industrialising Tuscany has never been easier. As we accumulate resources that we can invest into our cities, they evolve into metropoles and further allows us to accumulate more resources, manpower, and prestige. Tuscany will be the shining standard of European craftsmanship, maritime trade, and republican traditions."
 tus_defend_italy_title: "The Walls of the Federation"
 tus_defend_italy_desc:0 "Italy has often been subject to ambitious invaders, using northern Italy as a highway to easy money. Under our rule, this will no longer be the case. We will fortify the mountains of the federation and ensure no evildoers will be allowed in!"
 tus_integrate_the_north_title: "Integrate the North"
 tus_integrate_the_north_desc:0 "As populated as northern Italy is, the mismanagement of wasteful monarchs has ensured that a large part of the land has been left underdeveloped. Change this situation, and we may earn the gratitude and loyalty of our fellow Italians."
 tus_italian_republic_title: "Destiny of the Republic"
 tus_italian_republic_desc:0 "The Italian republic has come far from the typical signoria ruled by the Medici family, having evolved into a state much more in line with the common people. Even now, there is room left to improve in our governing administration, and we should not rest on our laurels when the opportunity to improve shows itself."
 tus_italian_economics_title: "Italian Economics"
 tus_italian_economics_desc:0 "The Italian economy is inexorably tied to maritime trade and control over the Genoan and Venetian seas. With the mountains of Italy hindering land-based intercontinental trade, merchants who seek to profit from our wealthy cities are always hiring trade vessels for their business. Without enough control over Italian trade, we cannot sustain the exponential growth our republic requires."
 tus_southern_growth_title: "Growth of the South"
 tus_southern_growth_desc:0 "The century of strife after Norman rule crumbled in southern Italy has resulted in disastrous consequences for the region. Prime farming lands desecrated repeatedly by marching armies razing and pillaging everything in sight, it will be an arduous task to ensure the regrowth of the south so that they can see prosperity once more..."
 tus_restore_trinacria_title: "Restore Trinacria"
 tus_restore_trinacria_desc:0 "The ancient isle of Sicily – or, as it was known before the Muslim invasion, Trinacria – was once a hub of Christian learning and scholarship, but the domination of the Shiite has resulted in a new and unique culture. A mixture of Arab, Norman, Neapolitan, and foreign Italian merchants have combined to make this island a bustling hub of unique ideas and traditions. We do not wish to remove this new identity; we merely wish to emphasize the Christian heritage of the isle, and to restore Trinacria to its rightful place at the centre of Italian learning."
 tus_enter_the_religious_wars_title: "Enter the Religious Wars"
 tus_enter_the_religious_wars_desc:0 "The Protestant Reformation has wreaked havoc across Europe, reigniting the religious zealotry that triggered the Great Schism between Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, and the ignomious Hussite Wars that ended in pyrrhic victory. These religious tensions have once again resulted in a devastating war that we cannot control. Let us hope we are on the right side of history in this conflict..."

 hansa_protectors_desc:0 "The twin cities of Hamburg and Bremen are the key centres of the Hanseatic League and are thus tasked with the defence of any Hanseatic city attacked by a foreign force. Unfortunately, we lack the military strength to fulfil our role successfully: if we are to solidify or even expand the League in the future, a larger army will be sorely required."
 hansa_weser_title:0 "Expand Hansa"

 hansa_jutland_title:0 "Claim Jutland"
 hansa_jutland_desc:0 "For centuries, traders have had the choice of sending their wares over land via Hamburg and Lübeck or sailing around Jutland, going through Denmark instead. We must end this dichotomy by making Jutland a possession of the Hansa: then, all traders going between the Baltic and the West will pass through our lands."
 hansa_pirates_title:0 "The Pirate Haven"
 hansa_pirates_desc:0 "The city of Visby, led by the Norse pagans in Gotland, has been a wretched thorn in the side of all Christendom for too long. Pirates depart from their ports to sack and loot the span of the Baltic Sea, destroying trade that would otherwise have come to our shores. Let us crush Visby under our heel, and reap the rewards!"
 hansa_neva_title:0 "Neva's Delta"
 hansa_neva_desc:0 "Trade with Novgorod and by extension the interior of Russia is vital for the prosperity of the Hanseatic cities. However, the Kniaz of Novgorod seeks to control the city's trade and edge out their competitors: us. We must ensure that our dominance over the city's markets is unchallenged, by seizing the mouth of the Neva for ourselves."
 hansa_greenland_title:0 "Settle Greenland"
 hansa_greenland_desc:0 "Greenland is a land known only from stories and fanciful tales told by the Norsemen of Norway and Denmark.

 hansa_north_sea_desc:0 "In the past, our main source of wealth was always trade with the East. Now, however, the riches of Russia are increasingly dwarfed by the immense wealth flowing from the west. The northern conduit of these new trade routes is through the North Sea to the Low Countries and England, but perhaps we could persuade traders to sail to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] instead..."

 hansa_end_sound_toll_title:0 "End the Sound Toll"
 hansa_end_sound_toll_desc:0 "Enough is enough. Controlling two pieces of land divided by sea should not imply control over the trade that passes between and through them. Flatter and woo them, or raze their cities and salt the earth. Either way, our trade shall flow freely from the Baltic through the Kattegat."
 hansa_baltic_trade_mission_title:0 "Secure Baltic Trade"
 hansa_baltic_trade_mission_desc:0 "The wealth of Lübeck and the Hanseatic League is built upon funneling the Baltic trade through our ports. In past years, we have let our control over those parts slip somewhat. We must reimpose our presence there to ensure that we can remain competitive against the new rising powers of the Baltic."
 hansa_norway_title:0 "End the Vikings"
 hansa_norway_desc:0 "Having contested the Norse barbarians via naval supremacy, we have made it clear that we are the true masters of the North Sea.

 hansa_schleswig_title:0 "Conquer Schleswig"
 hansa_schleswig_desc:0 "The muddy borderlands to our north, ruled over by a middling bunch of baptised Danes, cannot be trusted. We must venture forth, absorb these provinces into our realm, both to safeguard our cities from Norse aggression and expand our business interests in the peninsula."
 hansa_swedish_resolution_title:0 "Swedish Resolution"
 hansa_swedish_resolution_desc:0 "To the northeast, the Swedish have made a valiant attempt at bringing the true faith to the heathen wastes. Their efforts have waned however. They cannot be trusted to safeguard their Christian population alone. It is in their best interests - as well as ours - that they either come into our fold or submit."
 hansa_unknown_frontier_title:0 "The Unknown Frontier"
 hansa_unknown_frontier_desc:0 "The barbarian Norse sagas speak of strange and untamed lands far to the west. Many centuries ago, their most cunning sailors disappeared behind those frozen horizons and purportedly returned with fantastic tales. To this day, remnants of these adventurous efforts linger on. Surely, if we were to reappropriate these holdings, we could use them as a stepping stone..."
 hansa_baltic_diplomacy_title:0 "Baltic Diplomacy"
 hansa_baltic_diplomacy_desc:0 "A harsh and treacherous wilderness surrounds the Baltic. Vestiges of Christian civilisation endure despite constant heathen harassment. As vanguards of maritime trade, it is our duty to watch over these lone vestiges - perhaps even welcome them into our ranks, too."
 hansa_found_konigsberg_title:0 "Found Königsberg"
 hansa_found_konigsberg_desc:0 "Many a beautiful lagoon can be found on the southern Baltic coastline. Shamefully, the local barbarians have scarcely exploited the potential of the region. With our resurgent power seeping over the localities, it would be prudent for us to establish a new city adjacent to Danzig in a spot most appropriate - named aptly, Königsberg." 
 hansa_franconia_title:0 "Control Franconia"
 hansa_franconia_desc:0 "To the even further south, Franconia lays in a disunited and squabbling state. Unfortunately for the local lords, the greater powers at play have always benefited from this state of affairs. In the wake of the Kleinerkriege, many proud dukes were left penniless, their holdings devastated. Centuries later, the state of affairs hasn't much improved. Let us show the locals how they may benefit beneath us yet."
 hansa_rein_in_south_title:0 "Rein In the South"
 hansa_rein_in_south_desc:0 "With significant portions of Germany proper under our protection, many are calling for a complete consolidation of land east of the Rhine. Perhaps then we could claim a prestigious title, lost to history, for ourselves - that of the unifier of Germany." 
 hansa_saxony_title:0 "Dismantle Saxony"
 hansa_saxony_desc:0 "To the south, the ailing Saxons struggle with the many reins at their disposal. Disloyal, rebellious and conniving, their subjects thrash like errant dogs. It would be amusing if it weren't so costly to the local merchants. Fortunately, we have a fantastic idea - oust the Saxon overlords outright and seize control of their assets."

We have effectively formed the most efficient mercantile union Europe as ever seen, from virtually nothing - dwarfing even the luxurious ancient halls of Venice and the grandiose reach of Genoa."

 bav_unite_bavarians_title:0 "Unite the Bavarians"
 bav_unite_bavarians_desc:0 "Even Bavaria, once the crown jewel of the German kingdom, has seen its ducal ring fall into disrepair. Mending it will be tantamount to a declaration: that Germany too must unite under our banner."
 bav_tirol_title:0 "Subjugate the Habsburgs"
 bav_tirol_desc:0 "The young Habsburg dynasty has been a thorn in the side of Bavaria for too long, not to mention the passes they control are too important to leave in their hands. It is about time someone put them in their place."
 bav_helvetia_title:0 "Alpine Dominance"
 bav_helvetia_desc:0 "The Alps are the best line of defence in Europe. For that reason, they have always been very fragmented, as the preeminent power in the region - Switzerland, a hodge-podge of overlapping institutions and power-hungry burghers - is no longer able to keep its cantons in order. The mountains will be safer with us."
 bav_welfs_title:0 "Union with the Welfs"

 bav_styria_title:0 "End the Babenbergs"
 bav_styria_desc:0 "Under Luitpold, Bavaria stretched from the upper reaches of the Nordgau to the shores of the Danube river, and Austria was at the centre of this magnificent system; the Babenbergs have usurped the heartland of our crown, painting themselves as the rightful rulers of the German south, and their arrogance shall not stand."

 bav_catholic_empire_title:0 "A Catholic Empire"
 bav_catholic_empire_desc:0 "The Empire was born when the Pope posed a crown upon the head of Charlemagne. Our friendship with Rome has been tested, but it is for the good of the nation and of Christianity that we are not divided by petty discordances. Only by burning the heretics in their churches can we hope to stand against the storm."
 bav_saxony_title:0 "Invade the North"

 bav_swabia_title:0 "Legacy of Barbarossa"
 bav_swabia_desc:0 "Frederick Barbarossa, once the sword of the empire, is long dead. Under his rule, the Hohenstaufen dynasty went as far as to challenge the immortal Carolingians. In doing so, he rewrote the empire's power dynamics and placed the order of Germany in severe jeopardy. Still, his work is commendable and his goal, the same as ours, was clear: helping Germany rise from the ashes."
 bav_rhine_title:0 "Centralise the Rhine"
 bav_rhine_desc:0 "The Rhineland, prosperous in resources, is fraught by petty rivalries, the likes of which were long outgrown by the rest of the continent's crowns. A glorious campaign along the Rhine River is the only way to solve these disputes once and for all."

 swa_lotharingia_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Lotharingia, ever since its separation from the Frankish realm, has been ruled by a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, these rich lands of the Low Countries and the Duchy of Alsace should be united with us.

 swa_destroy_the_cantons_title:0 "Destroy the Cantons" 
 swa_destroy_the_cantons_desc:0 "Even with our successful conquest of the Swiss Cantons, the people there still fiercely resist our efforts to integrate them into our realm.

 swa_swabian_cloth_desc:0 "The cloth industry has been decentralised between the numerous states and cities in Germany.

 fkn_army_title:0 "Franconian Army"
 fkn_army_desc:0 "The once great Kingdom of Franconia is now weak, as our territories get usurped by local nobles. We should commit to building a Franconian army, an army that will strike fear into our enemies and remind them of the former power of the Franconian dukes, an army that would help us take back what is rightfully ours and further expand Salian power."
 fkn_swabia_title:0 "Dissolve Swabia"
 fkn_swabia_desc:0 "Before both our kingdom fell into fragmentation and weakness, Swabia has always been a rival of Franconia. Being two of the most powerful duchies in Germany we often fought over resources and land. We need to make sure this time when we rise back to our former power we will not have to deal with such a rival ever again. Now is the perfect opportunity to dissolve Swabia."
 fkn_bavaria_title:0 "Control Bavaria"
 fkn_bavaria_desc:0 "The situation of Bavaria is similar to the Swabian situation. A once proud kingdom and rival of Franconia, we must seize control of their lands before they can get powerful enough to end our existence."
 fkn_eastwards_title:0 "Push Eastwards"
 fkn_eastwards_desc:0 "The Western lands might be richer, but they are controlled by foes that we can not defeat for now. We must grow our power in the east, where the weak princes fight each other for power. If we can conquer the eastern lands and become a powerful kingdom we can take our armies to the west and dominate the region."
 fkn_franconia_title:0 "Reunite Franconia"
 fkn_franconia_desc:0 "Succession has fractured the lands of our kingdom for a long time. This will no longer be the case.

 fkn_switzerland_title:0 "Invade Switzerland"
 fkn_switzerland_desc:0 "Switzerland is a political oddity within the empire, a league of autonomous cantons functionally in a way similar to a republic. They should be conquered to secure our interests in the Northern Italian regions due to its location in the alps."
 fkn_tirol_title:0 "Subjugate the Habsburgs"
 fkn_tirol_desc:0 "The Habsburg dukes are growing in power. This is concerning news. We need to prevent the rise of another power like us in Germany, and in order to maintain our power monopoly we need to subjucate the Habsburgs."
 fkn_control_trade_title:0 "Control Rhenish Trade"
 fkn_control_trade_desc:0 "The Rhineland is a wealthy region and the crossroads of the empire where merchants from all across Europe congregate and trade. We should take control of this region to receive the most benefits from the trades being done here."
 fkn_capital_title:0 "Expand [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 fkn_capital_desc:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] is our proud capital city, and now a political and cultural center of Germany following our ascendancy. We should take measures to make this city more glorious, on par with Rome and Constantinople, a city where the other princes would stare in awe and envy, a city that would demonstrate our prestige, lineage, and might."
 fkn_printing_industry_title:0 "Develop the Printing Press"

 fkn_south_german_confederation_desc:0 "historically the more populous and cultured part of Germany, our new found dominance in the south has led many to believe that we ought to form a more lasting legacy in the region. A United southern Germany could become a power player in Europe."

 fkn_restore_greater_franconia_desc:0 "the region of Franconia was once much larger than it is today. Stretching from Rhine to Thuringia, much of our former domain has been lost to squabbling realms. Let us reunify Franconia, and formalize our culture across a greater territory."
 fkn_crown_of_arles_title:0 "Crown of Arles"
 fkn_crown_of_arles_desc:0 "The once mighty kingdom of Arles now stands sundered in the aftermath of the disaster at Valencia, the prestige of the old kingdom now lies open for the taking. If we can annex the region, the prestige of holding the crown of Arles would surely benefit us on the world stage, while serving as a foothold for future expansion routes."
 fkn_western_expansion_title:0 "Western Expansion"
 fkn_western_expansion_desc:0 "The Hohenstaufen’s of Lothairingia are isolated and far too concerned with their Carolingian rivals to adequately defend themselves from an eastern attack. The knights of Franconia shall cross the Rhine unify the empire once more!"

 fkn_frankish_kingdom_title:0 "Kingdom of the Franks"

 fkn_bohemia_title:0 "Weaken the Hohenstaufens"
 fkn_bohemia_desc:0 "Surrounded on all sides by the devilish Hohenstaufens, we will need to weaken their influence in Germany before we can establish our own dominance. The war torn lands of Bohemia would be a good place to start, as Hohenstaufen influence is by far the weakest in the lands of the Czechs, while also greatly improving our own wealth."
 fkn_unite_with_francia_title:0 "Unite with Francia"
 fkn_unite_with_francia_desc:0 "Many in our own realm view themselves as the descendants of the Franks, and our unique ties to the western realms have always been a source of pride and legitimacy. However the disastrous rule of the later Carolingians has proven that if the dreams of a Frankish empire are to be revived, it must be under the Franconian banner."

 fkn_contest_for_dominance_title:0 "Contest for Dominance"
 fkn_contest_for_dominance_desc:0 "Ever since the harrying of German, the north has been a shadow of its former self, divided and weak. A strong realm could exploit this, and gain dominance in the north, allowing a rebirth of German power in Europe."
 fkn_continental_system_title:0 "Continental System"
 fkn_continental_system_desc:0 "Mainland Europe will never prosper with the navel prosper so long as the Britannic pirates plague our coasts and markets. With our new found control over the east coast of the channel, we can begin to put pressure on the islanders and encourage our own traders abroad."
 fkn_establish_the_cavalry_corps_title:0 "Establish the Cavalry Corps"
 fkn_establish_the_cavalry_corps_desc:0 "Franconia is home to the majority of imperial knights in the empire, and has contributed many to battle for the emperor. While some might argue that the heavy cavalry of old is declining in value, reforms are needed to counteract this worrying trend. Let us establish a professional cavalry core, allowing us to continue to strike fear into the hearts of our enemies from horseback."
 fkn_blitzkrieg_doctrine_title:0 "Blitzkrieg Doctrine"
 fkn_blitzkrieg_doctrine_desc:0 "Our emphasis on cavalry has led to the observation of the decisive advantages that speed and rapid offense have on the battlefield. This led to the brightest military commanders of Europe to promote a new innovative doctrine involving rapid maneuvers and overwhelming show and awe on the battlefield, the Blitzkrieg."
 fkn_expand_the_imperial_knights_title:0 "The Imperial Knights"
 fkn_expand_the_imperial_knights_desc:0 "Our doctrine of Cavalry dominance, mixed with our recent unification with the western Franks has led to an increased number of former Frankish knights flocking to our banners.

 rhl_second_desc:0 "The Buchmesse - an established and lively book fair finding its roots in the 12th century - is a lively ground for the trade, marketing and diffusion of written texts.

 rhl_sixth:0 "Safeguard the Trade Routes"
 rhl_sixth_desc:0 "For centuries, enemies have squabbled over our wealth. This has hardened our spirits and taught us, through trial and error, the fine art of defence. Merchants near and far may feel safe traversing our lands, knowing we guard well against bandits and invaders alike."

With wry smiles, Rhenish merchants present themselves not as representatives of petty localities or feuding dukes, but as members of a realm wholly their own. Such is the way of our rise to power - a realm in its own right, a country for the Rhenish, represented by the Rhenish.

Mines, spiralling deep into the Earth, offer vast and seemingly limitless pockets of valuable iron, copper and other precious metals. Outside of fine jewelry and luxury goods, these marvellous metals are also vital to another key industry - war."
 rhl_industrial_revolution_title:0 "Industrial Revolution"
 rhl_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Across Europe, a revolution of industry is taking place. Workshops are becoming vast centres of production, employing hundreds upon hundreds of locals, gearing them with fine equipment, machinery and inventions devoted towards mass production. The brilliant minds behind these innovations promise wealth beyond our wildest dreams, so long as we empower them."
 rhl_enforce_sovereignty_title:0 "Enforce Our Sovereignty"
 rhl_enforce_sovereignty_desc:0 "Enemies surround us on all sides. From petty bandits to wily dukes, our rivals are numerous and seek to undermine our very state and way of life, all for their own benefit. Such is life within the fractured Holy Roman Empire. Existence is a struggle - one we must overcome. Sovereignty is not guaranteed - it is earned!"
 rhl_legacy_of_widukind_title:0 "Legacy of Widukind"
 rhl_legacy_of_widukind_desc:0 "Many centuries ago, the Pagan warrior Widukind led a bloody war against Charlemagne. Though his life has long since expired, his legacy lingers on in the hearts of many prospective German kings, especially in the shadow of continuous Frankish emperorship. Now, as we emerge as a dominant power of the Rhineland and the empire's German extent, we serve as a rekindling of that legacy, a reminder of history unforgotten."
 rhl_eastern_reach_title:0 "Eastern Reach"
 rhl_eastern_reach_desc:0 "With the Saxon lands integrated into our expanding realm, our nobles turn their concerned gazes to the east. Enemies of a very different fold linger beyond our borders - pagans, of ways Slavic and alien, utterly contrary and detrimental to the ways of the Holy Roman Empire. Should we neglect them, we could foolishly allow a pagan force to brew, amass and gather at our borders, spelling our doom. We must crush this development in the cradle and lay claim to their vast and ripe lands!"
 rhl_north_german_confederation_title:0 "North German Confederation"
 rhl_north_german_confederation_desc:0 "The north of Germany has been a temperamental and troubled region for quite some time. Pagan encroachments have brutalised the land. Mercantile squabbles have diminished financial confidence. Religious conflicts have troubled the minds of clerics and peasants alike. It is time for a new power - namely, us - to rise up, claim the mantle of regional dominance and establish peace and security across this troubled land."
 rhl_north_sea_power_title:0 "North Sea Power"
 rhl_north_sea_power_desc:0 "The North Sea may yet be ours! All across Scandinavia and the Baltic, merchants Christian and pagan alike are hailing our name. We are the protectors of trade and commerce, enabling towns as far west as the Lowlands to trade freely with the cold and frigid villages of Sweden. We must seize upon this growing reputation and bolster it even further - become a true power of the North Sea and perhaps a hegemon of naval might!"
 rhl_ruhrgebiet_title:0 "Ruhrgebiet"
 rhl_ruhrgebiet_desc:0 "The Ruhr Valley is bursting with potential. Producers of silk and other lords of local industries alike are rearing for a chance to establish monopolies and commercial dominance. If we invest in the cities local to their interests, we could provide them with the vast workforces and critical infrastructure necessary to create empires of wealth. This unique opportunity is ours for the taking!"
 rhl_rhenish_economic_hub_title:0 "Rhenish Economic Hub"
 rhl_rhenish_economic_hub_desc:0 "Our unique position has granted us prosperity untold. Over the long years, we have empowered our people, our formerly humble towns and villages and our fledgling merchant class - resulting in a booming economy which has caught Europe by surprise. We must not disappoint and slow down now. Rhineland must become an economic hub to draw the envy of the masses!"
 rhl_center_of_europe_title:0 "Center of Europe"
 rhl_center_of_europe_desc:0 "Our unique geographic location - as well as geopolitical - renders us a kind of centre of Europe. We sit at a crossroads between the dreaded English, the ferocious Franks, the wily Italians, the squabbling Poles and the beastly Norse, facilitating trade and commerce between them all. We must embrace this role wholeheartedly - declare ourselves the beating heart of Europe, once and for all!"
 rhl_unite_rhineland_title:0 "Unite Rhineland"
 rhl_unite_rhineland_desc:0 "Since time immemorial - since even the Romans, true and ancient of Antiquity proper - the Rhineland has been a land of contension. No one has ruled over it wholly and truly - until now. Until now, no one has mustered the strength and courage to be a hegemon of this beautiful land - until we came along. Now, we must proclaim our intent to rule wholeheartedly and prove ourselves!"
 rhl_invade_the_lowlands_title:0 "Invade the Lowlands"
 rhl_invade_the_lowlands_desc:0 "To the west, a wealthy and fruitful realm, minor in note, yet bursting with potential, stands lingering - the Lowlands, of population dense and tongue strange. For centuries, the Hohenstaufens and other petty lords alike have swung their ambitious gazes across the Lowlands, to no avail, for the Dutch are a hardy and resilient people. Surely they would do well under our benevolent rule?"
 rhl_reign_over_the_dutchs_title:0 "Reign Over the Dutch"
 rhl_reign_over_the_dutchs_desc:0 "With a foothold established in the Lowlands, we would be foolish to neglect our chance to integrate more. Vital Dutch cities, integral polders and burgeoning land reclamation projects stand to double, triple their wealth and productivity in years to come. Inaction could result in the rest of the Lowlands falling to another power - or worse, becoming united beneath a native regime. We must capitalise before it is too late!"
 rhl_splendor_herrenhausen_title:0 "Splendor of Herrenhausen"
 rhl_splendor_herrenhausen_desc:0 "Our capital stands in a sorry state when compared to the other mighty cities of Germany. It is in need of vital infrastructure! A church, perhaps even a cathedral, to draw the envy of all of Europe, must tower over its streets with magnificent spires! It must become the cultural heart of our realm, a symbol of our prestige and thus, a hub of trade."
 rhl_dusseldorf_title:0 "Raise Düsseldorf"
 rhl_dusseldorf_desc:0 "The humble lords of Berg come to us with a proposition. Aligned with good local learned monks and certain mercantile heads, they aspire to catapult Berg into new heights of prestige and wealth. So long as we pour due investment into the town, local interests would take care of the rest, fashioning of it a new city outright. Lay Berg to rest - raise Düsseldorf!"
 rhl_agricultural_revolution_title:0 "Agricultural Revolution"
 rhl_agricultural_revolution_desc:0 "An unintended side effect of the unfortunate bloodshed which has stained our soil is fertility. In the wake of much devastation, our farmers have prospered. This cannot last forever, though. Unfortunately, war is inevitable and famine will once more rear its ugly end sooner or later. We cannot sit idle - we must empower our farmers, launch an agricultural revolution within our territories, create the means to feed our destitute masses for years at a time!"
 rhl_kasseler_optics_title:0 "Kasseler Optics"
 rhl_kasseler_optics_desc:0 "The art of fine glass has become popular amidst our nobles. Merchants of luxury goods are displaying heightened intrigue in the idea of establishing monopolies, via concerted efforts and learned traditions, over the production of unique glassware. We should aid them in this unique venture."
 rhl_producing_jewelry_title:0 "Producing Jewelry"
 rhl_producing_jewelry_desc:0 "Jewelry, a marvellous and wealthy industry, has become incredibly popular across Europe, for obvious reasons. Our wily merchants are rearing at the chance to profit from this expanding industry. Problematic of course is securing a supply of silver, gold and other luxury metals. If we could secure mines either directly or indirectly - perhaps via generous benefactors abroad - we could make these dreams come true."
 rhl_modernize_fortresses_title:0 "Modernize Fortresses"
 rhl_modernize_fortresses_desc:0 "Owing to our unique position within a disunited and decentralised realm, we often find ourselves besieged with little notice. The Franks have the privilege of a vast realm, with borders expansive - we are but a humble state among hundreds of others. Enemies surround us on all sides. We must prepare, therefore, for the eventuality of sudden encroachment - it is inevitable." 
 rhl_end_salian_rule_title:0 "End the Salian Rule"
 rhl_end_salian_rule_desc:0 "To the south, the contemptible Salian lords cherish lands rightfully ours. Rhenish towns sit indignantly within their grasp. A little elbow grease should amend this situation!" 
 rhl_secure_rhine_title:0 "Secure the Rhine"
 rhl_secure_rhine_desc:0 "So long as Swabia stands in a state of squabbling, the lands east of the Rhine will never truly be secure. Encroachments from abroad - or worse, encroachments from within - threaten the stability of not only our realm, but those adjacent. We must dissolve the notion of Swabian self-determination!"
 rhl_enemy_of_rhineland_title:0 "Enemy at the Gates"
 rhl_enemy_of_rhineland_desc:0 "To the west, an enemy stands eternal. Whether united beneath one hegemonic power or reduced to a mass of roaming barbarians, the Franks have always posed an existential threat to the peoples of Germany. Their kings have perpetuated massacres, slavery, destruction and desolation untold. No more! We must take a stand against this old enemy, before they have a chance to inflict new horrors upon our fledgling empire!"
 rhl_peace_of_westphalia_title:0 "Peace of Westphalia"
 rhl_peace_of_westphalia_desc:0 "A dream of spring gleams in our minds. From the lowest peasants of Oberhessen, to the finest ladies of Niederhessen, hope burns on within hearts ripe with desperation - hope that one day, this bitter and cruel war may end, that it may not engulf entire lifespans, claim entire decades of our lives, bring about the true end of days foretold. Peace in our time - should we strive for it." 
 rhl_fine_german_print_title:0 "Fine German Print"
 rhl_fine_german_print_desc:0 "With literacy spreading like wildfire, it is only appropriate that we get with the times. Bookkeeping, commerce, literacy and monasticism alike rely heavily upon fine print and we would be fools to leave this industry in the hands of foreigners abroad."
 rhl_a_new_currency_title:0 "A New Currency"
 rhl_a_new_currency_desc:0 "The idea of paper currency has been permeating the minds of our learned men. It would enable greater control over our nation's ebbing and flowing wealth. Should we sufficiently balance our books and grasp our economy well enough, this strange dream may become an eventuality, especially when paired with our newfound industrial capacity for fine print."
 rhl_invest_in_education_title:0 "Invest in Education"
 rhl_invest_in_education_desc:0 "The ways of the past are indeed in the past. No longer are matters of philosophy, theology, governance and literacy but toys for humble monks. The way of the future is modern education - learned ways becoming available to those with coin and intellect, regardless of creed. If we were to invest wholeheartedly in education for all the Rhenish, we could achieve the finest meritocratic ideals."
 rhl_remilitarization_of_the_rhineland_title:0 "Militarization of Rhineland"
 rhl_remilitarization_of_the_rhineland_desc:0 "It is time we step up. To the west, the Franks, the Lotharingians, the English and the dreaded Saracens tout armies of immense strength. To the east, our rivals clash with the heathens of the Baltic, sharpening their blades, honing their prowess. We cannot be left in the dust!"
 rhl_finest_of_germany_title:0 "Finest of Germany"
 rhl_finest_of_germany_desc:0 "All over mighty Germania, once humble dukes are stepping up and fashioning themselves as military hegemons. Constant border quarrels, incessant disputes, the memories of the Kleinerkriege, all serve to instigate a broader culture of military professionalism and finesse. We would be foolish not to fashion a tradition for ourselves."
 rhl_conquer_bavaria_title:0 "Conquer Bavaria"
 rhl_conquer_bavaria_desc:0 "Brave and bold Bavaria, a land of looming peaks and old forests, lays in wait. We must not discount the possibility of a fearsome rival emerging from its potential. We must strike first, lay claim to this ferocious territory!"
 rhl_blood_and_iron_title:0 "Blood and Iron"
 rhl_blood_and_iron_desc:0 "For many centuries now, the ancient riches of Germany's south have been squabbled over by petty lords, treacherous kings and wily invaders alike. The status quo has been as temperamental as the wind - shifting from Frankish favour, to Magyar destruction, to Ottonian horrors on a whim. This instability must come to an end. All this blood and iron must not have gone to waste!"
 rhl_religious_matter_title:0 "Religious Matter"
 rhl_religious_matter_desc:0 "Chaos is engulfing Europe. The Pope vies desperately to maintain theological authority over the Holy Roman Empire's many princes and lords. Like weeds in a garden, new heresies, interpretations, of the good lord's word are springing up all over. Are these truly weeds, though? Are some not blossoming flowers of thought - vestiges of truth imparted by the faithful sincere? We must answer this gripping question of faith before we too disintegrate into confusion."
 rhl_faith_and_press_title:0 "The Faith and the Press"
 rhl_faith_and_press_desc:0 "The invention of the printing press and the proliferation of written word - whether true or false - has had dire consequences for all of Europe, resulting in war of iron, thought and paper. To prevent undue bloodshed from happening tenfold, we must ride the wave of change. Religious stability must be attained at all costs. Administrative cohesion must be imperative. Our people must know that we stand for the truth - whatever it may entail."
 rhl_technocratic_support_title:0 "Technocratic Support"
 rhl_technocratic_support_desc:0 "In this new age, innovation and technology are paramount. We cannot hope to surpass our many enemies if we do not integrate the latest ideas into our administration. Wise learned men, professionals of high standing, are vital to keeping up to date with the times."
 rhl_technology_of_hochofen_title:0 "Technology of Hochofen"
 rhl_technology_of_hochofen_desc:0 "With the industrial revolution at hand, our empowered learned men, of intellect staggering and numbers now innumerable, are proposing a host of new ideas to help combat our enemies and attain technological advancement. With new technologies, we can innovate new production techniques, construct new factories, create new machinery - catapulting us into heights yet unseen."

The end result was a total lost of Lower Austria, where the Slovenes eventually became a majority population. They are more than just trouble; giving the Slovenians any more time and they will overrun us with pure numbers!"

 tir_habsburg_diplomacy_desc:0 "The House of von Habsburgs rule with a prudent palm. Aware of their shortcomings, they achieve with diplomacy that of which cannot be done with a military; the victory at Styria with the cooperation of Barbarossa himself is chief claim to this. By buying into the hearts of the kings and queens of Europe, we can create miracles that cannot be achieved with cannon."
 tir_lombardy_title:0 "Conquest of Lombardy"
 tir_lombardy_desc:0 "The Iron Crown of Lombardy was pawned off to the Viscontis by the Carolingians following the fateful expedition into Andalusian territory, that ultimately resulted in the death and collapse of Frankish leadership. It is a humiliation of Imperial power that a symbol of divine right that the Carolingians believed could give a material value to the crown. By defeating and dethroning the Viscontis, we will inherit and restore the prestige of the Iron Crown."
 sty_prepare_coalition_against_fracia_title:0 "Francian Grievances"
 sty_prepare_coalition_against_fracia_desc:0 "Already weakened by the Ottonian machinations and losing all of their eastern holdings, they destroyed what little reputation that remained by declaring the unpopular Golden Bull. While granting us significant influence, it required the support of Francia to stave off only recently curbed threats in the eastern Imperial borders. However, petty succession squabbles have degenerated them to tribal feuds, paralysing the Empire. Their inaction has spiralled South Germany into chaos, with many ambitious princes, especially our eternal rivals the Hohenstaufens, running rampant. The grievances we hold for Frankish inepitude are not few!" 
 sty_end_francia_title:0 "Fall of Francia"
 sty_end_francia_desc:0 "The blowback from the Battle of Valencia shattered the power dynamic in Europe. Once safely under Carolingian control, the French duchies began to crave complete independence, the position of Emperor was rendered uncertain with a foolhardy heir to the throne, and their rivals in all directions began arming themselves, sensing an opportunity. A sick man of Europe, the decadence of foolhardy Carolingian heirs has left them insulated from Imperial affairs, and all princes have suffered under their negligence.

 hab_knights_of_austria_desc:0 "Unlike the rest of the Empire, the Austrian lands are dogged with treacherous mountain cliffs and undulating hillsides, making it almost impossible for well-armed foes to march upon our heartland. It has conversely become a strength for the Austrian knight order, who have trained unrelenting upon these mountains and hills every day for years, gathering endurance and waiting for the call to arms. If given a single moment to strike, they will strike true. All of Europe will tremble upon the sight of the knights of Austria!"

 sty_build_forts_desc:0 "There are innumerous threats to both our and the Imperial borders. The Magyars, having subjugated several local tribes, are seeking to further dominate the Carpathian basin. Without the presence of the Moravian empire, we are one of the only bastions strong enough to defend against incursion."

 tir_expand_court_title:0 "Expand the Court"
 tir_expand_court_desc:0 "Compared to the extenuous legacy of some houses in Europe, the Habsburg court is still trying to find its feet. Without any significant royal ties to the power centres of Europe, Tirol is susceptible to royal intrigue. We will need to expand both our holdings and our court in order to shore up this weakness."

 tir_might_of_the_pen_desc:0 "The origins of the Tyrolean state can be said to have traced back to diplomatic victories of the Habsburg diplomats, our silver tongue convincing other princes to join in a coalition against the Babenbergs. Without our successful machinations, we would have been quickly outnumbered and overrun by Styrian forces. We are the physical manifestation of the mighty pen, wittier and sharper than the sword!"

 sty_leader_of_austria_desc:0 "We once controlled the entirety of Austria, only to be backstabbed by traitorous Habsburg governors having aspirations of greatness way above their station. Though we have not returned to reclaim what was once ours, we have been patient and developed Styria proper, focusing on economical and cultural matters the Tyroleans have seemed to ignore. Armed with a signifcant power base once more, we are poised to once again become the leader of all the Austrian people!"

 sty_grand_duchy_of_austria_desc:0 "Where there is smoke, there is fire - as our power within the Empire solidifies, the Austrian cause is now marked with steel arms and ash wood. Heretics lay all around us, worst of all being the Hussite dominion in Bohemia, ruled by our perennial archenemies, the Hohenstaufens. If we wish to ever make a mark on the pages of history, the Grand Duchy of Austria will need to venture past the welcome forests of the Austrian Alps, and bring salvation to those around us."

Though we were tributary to the Swabians for a time, we soon outgrew their withering influence. Now, we are finally the most noble throne of Europe, holding the most influence of any German in Europe. The future is bright for our people, and we will lead them to a golden age!"

With their comparatively immense holdings in Carpathia supplanting their numerous subjects, there would come a time where the Germanic people would have to weather another invasion. To ensure our people are sheltered from such a scenario, we will need to maintain and expand Luitpold's Wall at the earliest opportunity!"

However, with only the Danube along the spine of Carpathia as a natural barrier against Slavic incursion, we will need to push all the way down to the Carpathian mountains before and defensive fortifications become worthwhile.

By fire and brimstone, we will convince the Electors that the time of the Carolingians is over for good, and that the Babenberg spears are much mightier than Charlemagne's legacy!"

Ever since the catastrophe in Iberia, the princes alike have all been reluctant to allow the Emperor to exploit the Imperial treasury. The election of king [Root.Monarch.GetName] to the position comes with the conviction of turning a new leaf. Who are we kidding though? There is little reason we can't use the gold for our own means - but the princes don't have to know that..."

In that time, the identity of the Empire has shifted and the hallmarks of its obligations adrift, protection from external threats lost to internal succession strife. The Empire is needed no more, for the German people are already a collective under our stewardship. May all of Germany prosper, and the world will hear our voices!"

The opportunistic Italians who dare to plot and pilfer everyone in sight have long been at odds with each other, always bickering over meagre matters. As their gazes stare each other down, we lie lurking - ready to return the favour of the 11th century. The Hohenstaufens are still a menace in the Empire, particularly the Lotharingian branch who maintain strength to compete with the Franks."

Not only were they an ignominious rival since the end of the Iron Century, they also interfered in Austrian internal affairs when Barbarossa razed the forests of Styria when he allied with the upstart Tyrolean Habsburgs. Although the Hohenstaufen Swabians have been in decline for centuries, the influence of their house has multiplied, with relatives on the thrones of Bohemia and Lotharingia, wielding significant influence in Europe. If we are to get revenge for Barbarossa, we will need to extinguish their entire house!"

 sty_end_hungary_desc:0 "While the victory at Pressburg was attributed to the leadership of Luitpold, it was the Austrian forces that formed the plurality of the coalition forces. Directly neighbouring the Magyars, we had the most to lose, and thus fought further than the rest and longer than fathomable. Even an eternity later, we still remember the jubilation and relief when the men returned home with the news. To reignite that feeling of glory, we must smite the Magyar threat, one last time!"
 sty_bohemian_troubles_title:0 "Converting the Hussites"
 sty_bohemian_troubles_desc:0 "As one of the few Slavic states to join the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemians have always dreamed of integrating themselves with German people. This dream was brutally crushed with the rise of Jan Hus and his movement, ultimately culminating in the violent Hussite Wars, fueled by foolish misjudgements by the Papal banner. This resulted in a shattered Bohemian realm ruled by a Swabian house without the heart of the people. Now that we have enforced control over Prague, we will need to ensure no Defenestration happens again."

From Graz to Königsboden, our great wall rebuffs all those who seek to destroy the prosperity our people have strived and toiled hard to earn. Unlike certain walls claimed to be impassable over in the Far East, we have maintained and expanded the walls to the far reaches of our borders, envisioned as the bastion of the Empire."
 tir_bavaria_title:0 "Crush the von Wittelsbachs"

Sensing the changing winds, they rose up and rode the coattails of Friedrich Barbarossa. earning his favour and being granted independence under tribute. However, the backstabbing royals soon withheld even that honour. Having fallen out of favour with both the Hohenstaufens and the Austrians, Bavaria stands alone in the frigid winds of south Germany. Isolated by threats on all sides, the von Wittlesbachs are poised to be decimated in the fields of Bavaria."
 tir_swabia_title:0 "Into Swabia"
 tir_swabia_desc:0 "When the treaty was signed that allowed us to break free from Styrian clutches, it was with the addendum that we would pay yearly tribute to the Swabians. Respecting Frederick Barbarossa's military prowess and influence, we adhered to their wishes to maintain peace in our realm. However, with their rapid decline over the last half millenium, they are a weak state riding on the coattails of the Hohenstaufen name. Let us put the legacy of Barbarossa to rest."

On the other hand, the Moravian fall was slow and agonising, losing territory after territory to pagan uprisings, independence wars and repeated invasions by the Magyar menace. Reduced to their founding states in Slovakia and Moravia proper, they are now just one of the many doomed old states of Europe."

The land of the Poles are battle hardened warriors, standing upon the leylines of culture and religion. While Mieszko was successful in converting his realm of power, the rest of Poland is split by heresy and paganism.

 ab_styria.1.t: "Ambitions of a Greater Realm"
 ab_styria.1.d: "By blood and iron, we have reclaimed our legacy. Not only have we risen like a phoenix from the ashes, rekindling our prestige, we have also laid claim to all of Austria proper. The wars have been gruesome - the diplomacy tiring, ruthless. Yet through all this, we stand tall anew, a titan of Germany once more, fit for modernity. Our army is a well-trained beast, standing ready to defend our new frontiers at the slightest incursion. Our court is a well-oiled machine, ready to receive guests and expel intruders. Our ambition is that of power - and it will never be fulfilled, for it is of a hunger bottomless, without end."
 ab_styria.1.a: "From all this conflict, we shall rise."
 
 ab_styria.2.t: "End of the Carolingian Tyranny"
 ab_styria.2.d: "For centuries, it has been known to all Austrians good and educated that by gazing west, upon where the sun sets, one would be gazing upon the home of our most tiresome enemies - the Carolingians. Far to the west, dwelling beyond the pristine Alps and the winding Rhine, the natural enemy of the German-speaking world has sat like a coiled serpent - always ready to seize upon our weakness, to exploit our follies, nipping and biting like the evil beast it is. However, this has come to an end at last - like some tale from old, heroes have risen up and slain the beast. They are none other than the good men of our army proud - slaying countless a Frank, putting an end to Carolingian domination. A new day soon begins - one free from their wrath!"
 ab_styria.2.a: "A parade in [183.GetName] is all we need to celebrate this victory."
 
 ab_styria.3.t: "Franz Anton von Raab"
 ab_styria.3.d: "Rising through the ranks of our nobility is a man clearly ahead of his time - esteemed lord, Franz Anton von Raab, hailing from Styria's central provinces. Championing the inherent honour of the nobility and the god-given rights of rulers and their allies, Raab has sought to streamline the bureaucracy and strengthen the grip of the nobility, enriching their coffers and in turn, securing their loyalty. By his hand, perhaps we can foster a trusting court environment, free from the intrigue that was once our downfall."
 ab_styria.3.a: "Maybe he would have been a great reformer in another timeline..."

 ab_styria.4.t: "Return of the Habsburgs"
 ab_styria.4.d: "It has been a turbulent history. For centuries now, we have struggled against the Babenbergs - the indignant, loathsome family which has sought to dominate Austrian politics for centuries. Careful scheming and clever diplomacy has finally brought about their ultimate downfall. Their persistance has not paid off - in the end, we have finally humiliated them for the last time, brutally striking their name from the history books. In their place, ours shall remain - and it is 'Habsburg' that shall be forever remembered."
 ab_styria.4.a: "We shall lay claim to the throne of Germany!"

 ab_styria.5.t: "Return of the Babenbergs"
 ab_styria.5.d: "Over the course of our long history, we have waxed and waned. Once a rising power, we were reduced to a shrivelled heap by our treacherous rivals. Scheming Habsburgs and envious rivals alike plotted our downfall, obliterated our righteous men, tarnished our holdings and seized lands. This was not to last, however. On the precipice of extinction, we recovered from the centuries of humiliation and reclaimed our honour - as well as our rightful clay and our place among the great powers." 
 ab_styria.5.a: "We shall lay claim to the throne of Germany!"

 RVN_second:0"Papal Ties"
 RVN_second_desc:0 "Unlike many of our neighbors, Ravenna has long been on friendly terms with the popes, largely for defense against the Venetians and Romagnas to our north. These good relations often lead to “benefits” amongst the wider Chrstian world."
 RVN_third:0 "Gothic Legacy"
 RVN_third_desc:0 "While Ravenna may not seem like much, we were once the capital of Italy, even superseding Rome for a time. The last capital of the western emperors, our true heyday would come under the Ostrogoths and their king Theodoric that replaced them. Sparing now expense, Theodoric forged Ravenna  into the envy of the west, and a true rival to Constantinople. We should rule Italy by right."
 RVN_fourth:0 "Drain the Swamps"
