 vol_convert_rus_title:0 "Convert Rus'"
 vol_convert_rus_desc:0 "Let us fulfill the promise we gave to the Pope. We shall create a new, Catholic Ruthenia and the conversion of Kiev, its ancient capital, will be our first triumphant victory."
 
 ab_shade_khan_title:0 "In the Shadow of the Khan" 
 ab_shade_khan_desc: "Despite all the hardships mighty Rus has been through, none have been as harsh as the years of domination under the Khans. Their bands of thieves and pillagers demand tribute from all the Sons of Rus. While it is currently impossible for us to overthrow the Khans at the moment, we can still work in the shadows against our neighbours. Once we build up enough power, we will crush the Tatars." 
 ab_tatar_yoke_title:0 "Break the Tatar Yoke"
 ab_tatar_yoke_desc:0 "While we have been strengthening our position, the Khanate has been suffering under their own incompetence. Their moment of weakness is the golden opportunity to prove to all other East Slavs that we are the ones who will free them from the Tatars. No more will we bow to the savage nomads in the east!" 
 ab_russia_dismantle_title:0 "Dethrone the Borjigins" 
 ab_russia_dismantle_desc:0 "The Golden Horde has for centuries ravaged and pilfered Rus for every ruble it had. Now we take the fight to them. The Cossacks have given their full support for this invasion. We will pillage their lands and drive out their people and replace them with proper Orthodox Slavs." 
 ab_russia_fields_title:0 "Liberate the Wild Fields" 
 ab_russia_fields_desc:0 "The plains of Zaporizhia and Yedisan are strongholds of proper Orthodox Ruthenian culture. Cossacks run free and true and actively resist the threat of the Tatars. The wheat fields of those lands also provide bread for the entire region. It is crucial that we secure such a valuable region from our rivals and the Tatars." 
 ab_russia_crimea_title:0 "Secure Crimea" 
 ab_russia_crimea_desc:0 "It is quite cold where we live, and the water our state utilises is unfortunately frozen for a decent portion of the year. To remedy this, the Crimean region is our next target for reclamation against the horde. We press onwards to liberate Holy Rus!" 
 ab_russia_consolidate_title:0 "Consolidate the State" 
 ab_russia_consolidate_desc:0 "The tumultuous stability of the region means that stability and prosperity are hard to come by. To ensure we do not get swept into the dustbin of history we must do two things. Raise an army to defend our borders, and ensure some semblance of stability for our people. Then we can focus on shattering our rivals." 
 ab_russia_cossacks_title:0 "Recruit the Cossacks" 
 ab_russia_cossacks_desc:0 "The Cossacks are proud and mighty people who have proven themselves capable warriors with their horsemanship and tenacity. The biggest threat posed by the hordes is their pesky horse archers who barrage us with arrows without letting our armies get a chance to retaliate. But what if we had our own well trained cavalry to fight back?" 
 ab_russia_game_title:0 "The Game of Thrones" 
 ab_russia_game_desc:0 "The Sons of Rus are divided into numerous states and families. Many are descendents of the Rurik that once united all of Rus under their command. The Pinesky family to the south maintains a grip over Ruthenia, and the republic of Novgorod dominates the north. This complicated situation would surely benefit from a few untimely deaths and invasions." 
 ab_russia_dniepr_title:0 "Control the Dniepr" 
 ab_russia_dniepr_desc:0 "The Dniepr is one of the most, if not the most important river in all of Rus. The Mongols made a grave mistake by not fully controlling all of it, allowing for numerous powers to split the river. If one nation were to control the most important estuaries of the Dniepr, then their dominance over Ruthenia would be secured. That nation will be us." 
 ab_russia_heirs_title:0 "Heirs of Ruthenia" 
 ab_russia_heirs_desc:0 "We have done it. The once shattered Rus has been reforged by the fire in the hearts of our people. The principalities have been united and the Horde is in full retreat. Now it is time to truly claim the title as the true Heir of Ruthenia. We will lead the Slavic world towards a new future under the new Tsar. God Save Rus! God Save the Tsar!" 
 ab_russia_eastern_title:0 "Eastern Principalities" 
 ab_russia_eastern_desc:0 "The principalities to the east are the first line of defence against any resurgent Mongol threat. While divided politically, if they were to fall, then all of Rus will fall with them. To ensure that the Mongols will never conquer Rus, we must control these princes ourselves." 
 ab_russia_novgorod_title:0 "Conquer Novgorod" 
 ab_russia_novgorod_desc:0 "Novgorod is one of the wealthiest cities to survive the Mongol invasion. Fully securing the city and the surrounding region will provide a great source of wealth to our state and give us a decent hold over the north not just politically but also economically."
 ab_rus_black_sea_fleet_title:0 "Chernomorsky Flot" 
 ab_rus_black_sea_fleet_desc:0 "With our liberation of Crimea we now have access to the Black Sea. Unfortunately, there are numerous powers that have strict control over it. Constructing a navy to wrestle control of the Black Sea will grant us a monopoly on its trade and a route to the most holy city of Constantinople" 
 ab_rus_sevastopol_title:0 "Found Sevastopol" 
 ab_rus_sevastopol_desc:0 "Now that we control a portion of the Black Sea, we need a proper base of operations and dockyard for our fleet. There is an excellent location with a natural harbour we can use, we just need some of our people to settle it." 
 ab_rus_tsargrad_title:0 "Claim Tsargrad" 
 ab_rus_tsargrad_desc:0 "The holy city of Constantinople has fallen from grace over the past few centuries of Angelid rule. The Basileus has clearly failed to properly hold the mantle of Christendom, it is time for the Tsar to take the mantle. The city will now be christened Tsargrad, a city fit for our holy Tsar!" 
 ab_rus_restoration_title:0 "Imperial Restoration"
 ab_rus_restoration_desc:0 "We have reconquered the lands once owned by the Second Rome, and while they have faded from history, there exists a movement amongst the clergy to restore the former empire and titles under a personal union. The Tsar will be both the Tsar of Rus and the Basileus of East Rome." 
 ab_russia_romania_title:0 "Balkan Intervention" 
 ab_russia_romania_desc:0 "The next step of our great conquest are the divided states of the Wallachians, Moldavians, and Transylvanians. With these territories under our control, we can then expand further into Europe proper." 
 ab_russia_moravian_legacy_title:0 "Legacy of Great Moravia"
 ab_russia_moravian_legacy_desc:0 "The first of the Slavs to deny the old pagan ways and embrace the light of Christ. The brothers Cyril and Methodius created the first slavic alphabet to help spread the true faith amongst the people. The once proud state of Moravia has fallen from grace, but their legacy lives on in us." 
 ab_russia_poland_title:0 "Unite the Sons of Lech" 
 ab_russia_poland_desc:0 "The Sons of Lech, more commonly referred to as the Polish, have been disunited for centuries. Infighting and civil wars after their Christianisation has left them weak and vulnerable to outsiders. We will reunite the Lechs and bring another Slavic brother back into the fold." 
 ab_russia_bulgaria_title:0 "Unite with Bulgaria" 
 ab_russia_bulgaria_desc:0 "Bulgaria has been the true Orthodox power in the Balkans since the decline of Byzantium. Their literary schools rank among the best in the world for their teachings and efficiency. We will relieve them of the burden of administering their vast state and show them how efficient the Sons of Rus are at ruling." 
 ab_russia_finnish_frontier_title:0 "Finnish Frontier" 
 ab_russia_finnish_frontier_desc:0 "The Finns have served as a frontier between the Norsemen and Russians, with neither Novgorod nor Sweden ever successfully conquering the region. While the Swedes may succeed in their grand crusade against the heathens, we still do not want any battles to be fought in Russia proper. The heathen Finns will embrace the light of Christ and learn to speak Russian." 
 ab_russia_secure_baltics_title:0 "Secure the Baltics" 
 ab_russia_secure_baltics_desc:0 "The Baltic states have somehow miraculously resisted attempts to convert them from both east and west. The Prussians, Lithuanians, Estonians, and Livonians constantly fight both themselves and crusading Germans, yet no power has come out on top. There should be little resistance to our expanding empire." 
 ab_russia_panslavism_title:0 "Embrace Pan-Slavism" 
 ab_russia_panslavism_desc:0 "The three Slavic brothers of Lech, Czech, and Rus have long been separated, but now we have brought the three brothers back together. While we may not agree on religion, with Catholics, Orthodox, and even a few Protestants, we are all Slavs, and we will stand together against all our foes."
 ab_rus_westernise_navy_title:0 "Westernise the Navy"
 ab_rus_westernise_navy_desc:0 "As it turns out, when a majority of your ports are frozen over half the year, your budget does not give much focus on the navy. Because of this, we have fallen significantly behind our rivals in the west. This cannot stand, we need to find a friend in the wide ocean of Europe to help us catch up and be a true naval power." 
 ab_russia_tame_steppe_title:0 "Break the Hordes" 
 ab_russia_tame_steppe_desc:0 "The hordes have been the eternal rival of Kievan Rus, with over five centuries of conflict between us. For a while, the hordes have nearly shattered Rus, but now we lead the charge into their homelands. No more will they ever raid us again, the hordes will now learn what it is like to have a harsh master." 
 ab_russia_harness_steppes_title:0 "Harness the Steppes"
 ab_russia_harness_steppes_desc:0 "With the horde problem now pushed back and less of a significant threat, we must turn towards our newly conquered areas that are quite undeveloped. Bringing in proper settlers like we have in Sevastopol and encouraging economic growth will help turn these barbarous steppes into a vital part of our economy." 
 ab_russia_caucasian_border_title:0 "The Caucasian Border" 
 ab_russia_caucasian_border_desc:0 "The Caucasian mountains have long separated the steppes and Rus from Anatolia and the Middle East. The tenacity of the people and the sheer inhospitality of the mountains create a natural fortification from any threats to the south. With the border under our control, we can prevent any resurgent empire from attacking our vulnerable southern flank." 
 ab_russia_central_asia_title:0 "Conquer Central Asia"
 ab_russia_central_asia_desc:0 "Our relentless push eastwards has run into a roadblock with several Mongol successor states occupying the region. Fortunately, we have plenty of experience dealing with these hordes. Our soldiers will ensure that their destruction is swift and brutal." 
 ab_russia_dragon_title:0 "The Dragon and the Tsar" 
 ab_russia_dragon_desc:0 "Our push eastwards has reached its climax, and our discovery of another superpower has divided our court. Some view the Dragon Throne as a threat that we must defeat in battle to secure the east as ours. Others view the Chinese Emperor as an ally who would benefit from new trade routes between our great states. Of course, the choice is ultimately up to the Tsar." 
 ab_russia_empower_title:0 "Empower the Clergy" 
 ab_russia_empower_desc:0 "The Boyars and merchants have a long history of opposing the leadership of the Tsardom. The only institution to have always shown their loyalty to our people is the Church. The people of Rus are faithful and the clergy are willing to provide more legitimacy and taxes to our government in exchange for more privileges." 
 ab_rus_lavra_title:0 "Restore Pechersk Lavra" 
 ab_rus_lavra_desc:0 "Once a small monastery, the Pechersk Lavra has become the centre point of Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia. Years of occupation from the Mongols and deterioration has resulted in this once grand monastery to become a small remnant of its former self. It would please the local clergy and bring peace of mind to the peasants if we restore it." 
 ab_russia_patriarchate_rus_title:0 "Patriarchate of All Rus"
 ab_russia_patriarchate_rus_desc:0 "Rus is a vast land filled with numerous autonomous bishops and priests who spread the true faith. While there is no real issue with this, we can promote a more unified national identity. One Patriarch shall oversee the entire church and ensure a unified doctrine amongst our people." 
 ab_russia_church_state_title:0 "The Church and the State"
 ab_russia_church_state_desc:0 "The clergy has been promoted to the most influential group in our government. All across the land, the Clergy works hand in hand with the ministers of the Tsar to ensure local laws are being followed and that all the people are faithful. We must further solidify this relationship between the church and state to ensure that the Mighty Bear of Rus does not falter in her quest to conquer all that belongs to her!"
 ab_russia_autocratic_title:0 "Autocratic Rule" 
 ab_russia_autocratic_desc:0 "Changes are coming to Europe. The idea of the divine right of monarchs to rule their state is extremely appealing to the Tsar. Unfortunately, forces across the government refuse to let go of their ancient powers. Placating these factions while increasing the power of the Tsar is our new top priority." 
 ab_russia_streltsy_title:0 "Modernise the Streltsy" 
 ab_russia_streltsy_desc:0 "The Streltsy are a social class of poor farmers who excel at use of firearms. Sadly, we have not been in the greatest of financial situations and the Streltsy class usually farms to accommodate our lack of wages. This results in more time farming and less time campaigning or training. By actually paying these soldiers their wages and making sure they spend their time training, we can ensure the Streltsy remain a professional corps in our army." 
 ab_russia_manufactories_title:0 "State Manufactories" 
 ab_russia_manufactories_desc:0 "Most of our income comes from taxing the peasants and tariffs placed on exported raw materials. We have no shortage of raw materials from our conquest of Siberia, and it would be more profitable to transform these materials into more profitable goods to export at higher rates. The state shall sponsor manufactories across the land to boost our production." 
 ab_russia_prikazy_title:0 "Establish the Prikazy" 
 ab_russia_prikazy_desc:0 "Our lands are vast and quite difficult to administer. There are just too many villages and outposts spread too wide across our Tsardom. The Tsar has taken it upon themself to create a new organisation method for our territories called the Prikaz. Each of these Prikazy will be administered by different parts of our government to ensure maximum efficiency." 
 ab_russia_industrial_title:0 "Industrial Centers" 
 ab_russia_industrial_desc:0 "Innovations from the west have created a new type of machine that is able to harvest coal from deep below the earth. That coal can then be used to help boost our production by over tenfold. We just need to pay the fees to build these new furnaces." 
 ab_russia_revolution_title:0 "Answer the Revolution" 
 ab_russia_revolution_desc:0 "The winds of change are sweeping through Europe, ideas of liberty and equality and clashing with the ideas of autocracy and supremacy of old. The peasantry have clung to these new found ideas and the aristocracy is fighting to put down the flames of revolution. What path will we follow in this pivotal moment in history, will we ensure the authority of the Tsar, or spread freedom throughout the east?" 
 ab_russia_stabilize_title:0 "Stabilise the Interior" 
 ab_russia_stabilize_desc:0 "The lands of Rus have not known peace of prosperity for years, and now that we have united these war torn lands, we can start to make life better for everyone. Of course we need to ensure the government is profitable and loyal before we can help the peasants. " 
 ab_russia_bread_title:0 "Ruthenian Chernozem" 
 ab_russia_bread_desc:0 "Chernozem is a nutrient rich black soil which is abundant in the lands of Ruthenia. Its properties allow for extremely efficient production of wheat. By subsidising local farms and mills in the region, we can ensure that there will always be a surplus of bread for our people. No one will ever go hungry again!" 
 ab_russia_fur_title:0 "Expand the Fur Market" 
 ab_russia_fur_desc:0 "The fur trade in Western Europe has driven the beaver population to near extinction, which has left Europe without fur. Luckily for us, Siberia has plenty of furry animals for us to harvest. With a little bit of funding from the Tsar, we can expand our fur market to help dominate the European fur market and turn remarkable profit." 
 ab_russia_capitals_title:0 "The Two Capitals" 
 ab_russia_capitals_desc:0 "Two great cities have long been in a friendly rivalry over who will be the centre of Rus. Novgorod to the north has grown to great heights during the years under the Tartar yoke. Meanwhile, Kiev remains the ancient capital of Rus and still is the most important city in Ruthenia. The Tsar wishes to transform one of these mighty cities into the capital of our Tsardom, but that does not mean we can just ignore the other." 
 ab_russia_hometrade_title:0 "Control the Home Trade" 
 ab_russia_hometrade_desc:0 "Our lands have plenty of resources that we wish to trade with our contemporaries in the west. Sadly, the harsh environment of the taiga and tundra makes trading difficult half the year. You have to spend money to make money, and the Tsar is willing to spend money to create trade centres that remain open year round." 
 ab_russia_window_title:0 "Window to the West" 
 ab_russia_window_desc:0 "Kiev and Novgorod are grand cities, but their location is not the most accessible to the West. The Tsar has funded surveys across the coast and discovered a perfect location for a city in Neva. This small harbour will become a grand rival to Novgorod and Kiev, but have the added benefit of being able to trade freely with the west."
 
 
 
 
 #NovgorodRus
 ab_nov_rein_title:0 "Rein in the Princes"
 ab_nov_rein_desc:0 "Ever since the Mongol power waned in our motherland, our people have sat fragmented. Petty rivalries between princes prevented cooperation and led to a state of fragmentation and squabbling. A state that we have, as the dominant power of the region, now rectified. No more will we be divided, from within or without!"
 ab_nov_dniepr_title:0 "Secure the Dnieper"
 ab_nov_dniepr_desc:0 "The Dniepr is one of the most, if not the most important river in all of Rus. The Mongols made a grave mistake by not fully controlling all of it, allowing numerous powers to split the river. If one nation were to control the most important estuaries of the Dniepr, then their dominance over Ruthenia would be secured. That nation will be us."
 ab_nov_heirs_title:0 "Heirs of Ruthenia"
 ab_nov_heirs_desc:0 "The once shattered Rus has been reforged by the fire in the hearts of our people. The principalities have been united, and the Horde is in full retreat. Now it is time to claim the title as the true Heir of Ruthenia truly. We will lead the Slavic world towards a new future under the new Tsar. God Save Rus! God Save the Tsar!"
 ab_nov_pskov_title:0 "Conquer Pskov"
 ab_nov_pskov_desc:0 "The Baltic is our Window to the West. Pskov, once the furthest-west Russian state, was once the only thing between us and controlling the eastern Baltic Sea. Now, we have brought them into the fold."
 ab_nov_baltic_title:0 "Window to the West"
 ab_nov_baltic_desc:0 "While our main trading port in the Gulf of Finland serves us well, the snow and ice make it useless for almost half the year. Expanding to warmer waters, we can now continue our shipping year-round, cementing our control of the eastern Baltic Sea and putting us in place to control it!"
 ab_nov_lithuania_title:0 "Defeat the Lithuanians"
 ab_nov_lithuania_desc:0 "The Lithuanians have fallen like the rest, brought to heel and integrated into our ever-expanding domain. But we will not stop here. Novgorod will prevail, and we will create our own Mare Nostrum in the Baltic Sea!"
 ab_nov_baltic_security_title:0 "Baltic Security"
 ab_nov_baltic_security_desc:0 "Lithuania fell, and soon did the Prussians after them. One of the most important trading cities of the Baltic Sea, Danzig, now sits firmly within our grasp. We are already reaping the benefits of increased trade from the west, but why stop here? The riches of the Baltic Sea await!"
 ab_nov_fur_title:0 "Expand the Fur Trade"
 ab_nov_fur_desc:0 "The abundance of northern game animals within our realm means both a supply of meat for our people and an abundance of fur to trade. While not as lucrative as silk or gold, it is still a valuable resource. Our expanded fur trade will be one of many pillars of our economy."
 ab_nov_hegemony_title:0 "Baltoscandian Hegemony"
 ab_nov_hegemony_desc:0 "We now sit as the strongest power in the Baltic Sea. Even grander than Cnut’s Northern Empire. Riches flow to our capital, people are happy, and our children may grow fat and old on the fruits of our labour. What the future will look in store for us now looks even brighter."
 ab_nov_finland_title:0 "Secure Finland"
 ab_nov_finland_desc:0 "The pagan Finns to our east have proved valuable in the past. First, they proved a helpful buffer and distraction against Viking raids. Then, when the Vikings were replaced with Swedish crusaders, they were beneficial against them too. Now, they have outlived their usefulness. The Gulf of Finland is now entirely in our control, as well as the rest of Finland itself."
 ab_nov_sapmi_title:0 "Subjugate the Sápmi"
 ab_nov_sapmi_desc:0 "The Sápmi people fell as the Finns did before them, the last remaining holdout of the Suomenusko pagans. The Ukko shrine will remain – for now. But one thing is for certain: this land belongs to us now. Regrettably, this puts us in direct contact with the Norwegians and Swedish Crusaders, but perhaps their conflicts could be used to our advantage."
 ab_nov_crusade_title:0 "End the Crusade"
 ab_nov_crusade_desc:0 "The conflict of faith that the Swedes brought to the Baltic states has finished. Their crusade is over, doomed to fail from the start, and their lands are ours now. The only question now is what to do about these Norsemen on our doorstep...?"
 ab_nov_rein_princes_title:0 "Expand the Domain"
 ab_nov_rein_princes_desc:0 "While we are undoubtedly the largest domain among our peers and lesser to the south, it is no secret that much of our lands are barren and frigid wastes. Therefore, we must seek out more land to bolster our resources."
 ab_nov_end_rurik_title:0 "End Rurik's Bloodline"
 ab_nov_end_rurik_desc:0 "Rurik’s blood still flowed through the rulers of the land, princes who spit in the face of what was once the greatest realm since the Roman Empire. We have made sure that the weed has been nipped in the bud. Control of the region has been wrenched from Rurikovich hands. We are all the better for it."
 ab_nov_perm_title:0 "Secure Perm"
 ab_nov_perm_desc:0 "Much as the Baltics are our Window to the West, Perm remains our Window to the East. It’s an independent princedom that stands between the Urals and us, useful as a trading partner and even more so as a buffer state. However, if we want to break past those mountains, we must subjugate them or integrate them into our lands outright."
 ab_nov_beyond_title:0 "Beyond the Urals"
 ab_nov_beyond_desc:0 "Like a childhood home, the Ural Mountains offer us shelter from invasion from the East. But, like all childhood homes, there comes a time when the child must move on. We will break past the safety of the Urals and swarm east just as the Mongols once swarmed west!"
 ab_nov_mother_cities_title:0 "The Mother of Cities"
 ab_nov_mother_cities_desc:0 "Great Kyiv! Holy Kyiv! The Mother of Cities! Ruthenia’s grand capital has been restored to its former glory! May it forever remain a beacon for all of Rus! May it reign forevermore and never fall again!"
 ab_nov_threaten_rome_title:0 "Threaten the Romans"
 ab_nov_threaten_rome_desc:0 "With Crimea held, we are free to expand to all shores of the Black Sea as we please. We may even threaten the Romans in Constantinople! Now that our mighty southern fleet has been built up, we can grow to our heart’s content!"
 ab_nov_crimea_title:0 "Control Crimea"
 ab_nov_crimea_desc:0 "Crimea is the last step of a trade route that spans through rivers and over land from sea to sea. The route from the Baltic to the Black Sea is ours and ours alone. We will reap the rewards, for they are plentiful!"
 ab_nov_mongols_title:0 "Banish the Mongols"
 ab_nov_mongols_desc:0 "The Mongols, the scourge of this land and our people, are no longer! We have defeated them in battle, taken their forts, and driven them from our lands. If they return, we’ll be ready!"
 ab_nov_wendia_title:0 "Wendish Intervention"
 ab_nov_wendia_desc:0 "Much like the eternal conflict between the Norse and Crusaders to the north, the Wendish states to the south of the Baltic are stuck in war after war against themselves. It is time we do something about it and end their fighting."
 ab_nov_toll_title:0 "Control the Sound Toll"
 ab_nov_toll_desc:0 "The Sound Toll at the mouth of the Baltic Sea is in Danish hands no longer. It is only fitting that, as the Hegemon of the Baltic Sea, it belongs to us. Like the Hellespont, it shall stand as a gate to our bountiful and glorious empire!"
 ab_nov_new_world_title:0 "Discover the New World"
 ab_nov_new_world_desc:0 "Our more daring explorers have set sail beyond the horizon, following mere rumours from Norwegian fishermen and sailors in our realm. They have returned bearing stories of not only lands like ours but lands more bountiful than we could ever dream of."
 ab_nov_new_rus_title:0 "Found New Rus'"
 ab_nov_new_rus_desc:0 "Our colonial presence in the New World has been firmly established. New Rus shall be our stronghold in this foreign realm, which we shall base our further efforts on. A jewel in our Empire will be a prime example of our prestige."
 ab_nov_canada_title:0 "Tame the North"
 ab_nov_canada_desc:0 "The northern areas of this new world are much like our homeland. There aren’t many others as well suited to this land as the Rus! We will not just survive here, but thrive! This shall be a new home for our people, and a cornerstone of our great Empire."
 ab_nov_greenland_title:0 "Claim Greenland"
 ab_nov_greenland_desc:0 "Greenland is an island between Iceland and this new world. Walrus tusks have become quite a commodity, and Greenland is abundant in them. A land so bountiful and close to our realm open for the taking? It’s almost too easy."
 ab_nov_westernise_navy_title:0 "Westernise the Navy"
 ab_nov_westernise_navy_desc:0 "Throughout our naval campaigns along the Baltic Sea, it has been clear to us that our navy could be better. Decades of lagging behind have left our strongest ships in shambles against our foes. Using modern designs, we have learned from our enemies and improved our ships."
 ab_nov_gotland_title:0 "Deal with the Pirates"
 ab_nov_gotland_desc:0 "Raids on our (and most other shores of the Baltic) will come to an end. Gotland is ours, the pirates who lived there before were driven out or captured. One more stone on the path to Baltic security has been laid."
 ab_nov_baltic_fleet_title:0 "Baltic Arsenal"
 ab_nov_baltic_fleet_desc:0 "In order to enforce our authority in the Baltic Sea, we were required to modernize our navy. Pirates, Norsemen, Crusaders, Wends, and the Hansa all pose threats to us. With our new, mighty fleet, we’ll have the strength to force them all back!"
 ab_nov_reform_veche_title:0 "Reform the Veche"
 ab_nov_reform_veche_desc:0 "The Veche of Novgorod has served us well, offering the peoples of our lands a say in our policies. As we have grown, however, the cracks in the systems have begun to show. Our reforms will correct this and stabilise our growing trade network."
 ab_nov_trade_network_title:0 "Northern Trade Networks"
 ab_nov_trade_network_desc:0 "The frigid lands of our home have been tamed. Through our public works, we have created a vast trade network over ice and snow that will work even through the harshest winters. Not only with this increase productivity, but the connection between towns and settlements will allow information to flow quickly and freely."
 ab_nov_rusa_title:0 "Rusa Salt Mine"
 ab_nov_rusa_desc:0 "The salt mines of Rusa are a valuable resource in our trade network. By expanding it and increasing its output, we will have enough for ourselves and our trading partners abroad."
 ab_nov_bogdanov_title:0 "Bogdanov Trading Guild"
 ab_nov_bogdanov_desc:0 "The Bogdanov Trading Guild has come into prominence in recent years. They are influential, widespread and, most importantly, rich beyond belief. They are willing to cooperate and will be a powerful asset to us."
 ab_nov_patriarchate_rus_title:0 "Patriarchate of All Rus"
 ab_nov_patriarchate_rus_desc:0 "The Patriarch will be held back by Constantinople no longer! The Patriarchate of All Rus reigns supreme over these lands and their people, tying our bonds closer together than ever before. Now, we can indeed be greater than even the Romans themselves."

 string_start_title_ruthenia:0 "Heirs of Ruthenia"
 string_start_ruthenia:0 "Following the passing of §YYaroslav the Wise§! in AD 1054, the §YKievan Rus’§! found itself dismantled amidst a bitter succession, leaving Ruthenia severely weakened and disunited amidst a sea of growing troubles. Hoping to restore past glories, the Rus’ numerous princes instead preferred to wage bloody, fratricidal wars against one another. Alas, as a consequence of these desperately brutish attempts to press their ever-diluting claims to Kiev, the descendants of Rurik's great legacy reduced the very prize they had been eyeing to a pathetic shadow of its former self.\n\nFurther piling woes upon the shoulders of Ruthenia, the sickly Kievan Rus’ and a half dozen other principalities had chosen to aid the §YCumans§! against an enigmatic, seemingly unstoppable invader in AD 1223. Despite ensuring their best men were sallied out for war, the Ruthenian and Cuman forces suffered a savage defeat by the §YMongols§! at the §YBattle of Kalka§! in the spring of that year; of every ten Ruthenian soldiers who fought at the Kalka River, only one would return home alive.\n\nThis crushing defeat at the hands of an as-yet unknown opponent irreparably weakened the Ruthenian princes, depriving them of much needed manpower and leadership, thus cementing a steeper decline for Ruthenia. The final nail in the coffin arrived upon the Mongol Invasion of Ruthenia in AD 1237, when §YSubutai§! commanded an overwhelming strike against the numerous principalities, crushing most meaningful resistance by AD 1240, and forcing §YNovgorod§! to pay tribute.\n\nOf course, with the growing instability inside the Mongol Empire, the strangling grip of the §YTatar Yoke§! soon began to wither. The §YGolden Horde§!, which had extracted tribute from and routinely terrorised the Ruthenians for a century, would enter sharp decline in the 14th century. Despite maintaining a semblance of territorial integrity, the Golden Horde was no longer capable of ensuring harmony amongst its already unruly and disloyal tributaries.\n\nProvided with this breath of fresh air, the Ruthenians saw fit not to unite against and finally overthrow their despised slave drivers, but rather to spill one another's blood over which principality ought to reunite the Rus’. §YVladimir§! - favourite of the Mongol Empire - was the first of these to fall, being sundered by half a dozen rivals, with §YPolotsk§! and §YGalicia-Volhynia§! following soon after. Powerless to stop them, all the Golden Horde could do was sit idly by as its rebellious subjects began the long process of consolidation, and the tax income dried up.\n\nDespite the Golden Horde being pushed back by princely coalitions at the rivers §YOka§! and §YKharkov§! in AD 1408 and 1409 respectively, the Tatar Yoke remains around Ruthenia's neck, if only loosely. Despite increasing efforts in §YNovgorod§!, §YMuscovy§!, and §YKiev§! to commence the fatal struggle, progress has been marred by the Golden Horde's refusal to die. If the §YHeirs of Ruthenia§! are to tear off the last shackles which bind them to the Khan, they must band together, or die together, lest the vastness of Rus’ devours them."

 ab_novgorod.2.d:0 "At the confluence of the rivers Neva and Okhta, in the sparsely populated land of Ingria, lies the potential gateway to Baltic trade, and through that, the untapped German markets. A most enticing prospect for the merchants of Novgorod, the desire to establish a permanent outpost in Neva has gripped the public's interest as of late. This desire influenced perhaps none more so than the enigmatic Brothers Bogdanov - heads of lucrative Bogdanoff and Bogdanoff Merchant's Guild. Bankrolling one of the largest private expeditions in Novgorod's history, the Bogdanovs have quickly set about laying the groundwork for a sprawling megalopolis and trade hub which they describe as the 'Window to the West.' Upon its completion, the city of Bogdangrad is expected to entrench the Bogdanovs' influence over Novgorod, and lay the Hansa bare before them. Forward, to the West!"
 ab_novgorod.2.a:0 "They bought? Bump it."
 ab_rus.1.t:0 "The Tatar Yoke"
 ab_rus.1.d:0 "Our kings were slaves, our soldiers orphans. For two centuries, our cities and our states have been under the firm grip of the hordes on horseback, inhabitants of the great plains and lords of all that they have ravaged. Being degraded from princes among princes to mere tax collectors, some have thrived – many more have perished. However, even in our dire straits, we can see light at the end of the tunnel. Lately, control has slipped farther and farther away from the hands of the unworthy – so far, in fact, that it would take but one decisive blow to break the Tatar yoke."
 ab_rus.1.a:0 "We shall strike first, and strike hard!"
 ab_rus.7.t:0 "The Destruction of Sarai"
 ab_rus.7.d:0 "Sarai, stronghold of the Steppes, from whence once Mongolian warlords extorted tribute and persecuted our forefathers, is ours. While the obvious choice would be to sack it, like they would any city of their own conquest, our merchants argue that it could become more useful and prosperous under our hands than it ever was before."

 ab_rus.6.t:0 "The Birth of Pan-Slavism"
 ab_rus.6.d:0 "Briefly after our own migration westwards, the Slavs splintered into the many denominations we know today. But a sentiment, as of our most recent victories, is growing in the hearts of each one of us – one of national unity, one of cultural fervour, one of brotherhood. Our state, the most powerful among the children of the very first Slavs, is viewed as the harbinger of a new era, one in which Slavs may live prosper and potent under our hegemony. The Third Rome, it seems, was never a Rusian one, but it was the symbol of this new movement – Pan-Slavism."
