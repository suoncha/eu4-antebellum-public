 mann_events.1.t: "The Manx Secession"
 mann_events.1.d: "A delegation of the Manx people have met with leaders of [NOR.GetName] in [NOR.Capital.GetName].  They have made an official request for independence, which does not come as a surprise, considering how loosely they have been governed by the crown for generations. We can, of course, dispute this action outright, as Mann is rightful [NOR.GetAdjective] clay. If we were to negotiate with them, however, perhaps we could fetch a ransom for their independence?"
 mann_events.1.a: "Nonsense. Execute the delegates!"
 mann_events.1.b: "The crown could use funds at the moment.."
 mann_events.1.c: "For Odin, we let them go. We have no use for them."

 mann_events.2.t: "The Coveted Manx Silk"
 mann_events.2.d: "Despite any doubts that may have been placed upon them, the explorers in search of silk, sponsored by the crown, have returned. These men return with more than just foreign treasures, but information regarding the creation and maintenance of silk products. These men have been granted some land in [4368.GetName] to establish an operation to produce this silk, and have pledged a portion of their profits to the crown as repayment for funding their expedition."
 mann_events.2.a: "Their silk shall cover my body. Truly regal!"

 mann_events.201.t: "The Search for Silk"
 mann_events.201.d: "Our efforts to modernize our economy and transition from one based on herding to one based on production has been fruitful. The people have benefited from this, and thus they are happy. A happy population is easy to govern.\n\nHowever, a small group of entrepreneurial explorers has recently petitioned the crown to set sail on an expedition into the Mediterranean in search of the trade secrets of silk.. Such an endevor would cost a sizeable amount to fund, but assuming it was successful, could have large implications on our economic future."
 mann_events.201.a: "They have [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s blessing. Go fourth."
 mann_events.201.b: "We have better things to do with said funds."


 mann_events.3.t: "The Cleansing of Strathclyde"
 mann_events.3.d: "It has been made apparent to us that the cultural differences between us and the other inhabitants of the British Isles are incompatible. Despite our previous efforts, many are resistant to integration into our union. For that reason, they must be put the the sword if they resist further integration attempts by the crown. The people of Strathclyde have been no exception, and it has been said that they are to be an example for those who resist future cultural integration into the empire. This may upset other people within Mann, but it is a small price to pay to make a statement as strong as this: Become one of us, or die like the rest of them."
 mann_events.3.a: "Welcome, Strathclyde, to the family!"


 mann_events.4.t: "Proclaiming the Imperium of Mann"
 mann_events.4.d: "Long has it been since the time of English hegemony within the British Isles. Through shrewd diplomacy and sheer military might, the might crown of Mann has united the isles under a single banner, the banner of Mann! To celebrate this achievement, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proclaimed a coronation ceremony, dubbing themselves the 'Emperor of Mankind' in honor of our Manx brethren throughout the Isles, as well as any overseas. The Imperium of Mann shall not only rule the Isles, but shall focus her sights overseas, be it into Scandanavia, Europe, or to lands far over the horizon.\n\nLong live the Emperor of Mankind! Long may he rule! Long live the Imperium of Mann!"
 mann_events.4.a: "Now, to manage those pesky folk to the south of us.."


 mann_events.5.t: "The Faithful of Mann"
 mann_events.5.d: "The pious among us would claim that we are a nation of devout Catholics, with nothing but love and admiration for the virgin, Mary, and her son, the Son of Man, Jesus. Funnily enough, there are many holdovers from the Norwegian times, claiming that the Allfather, Odin, is the king of our world. Though nominally a Christian, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a chance to set the record straight and to decide the official state relgion of [KOI.GetName]. Shall we continue to pursue the Gospel and the good word presented within? Or shall we adopt the faith of the Northmen?"
 mann_events.5.a: "Father, you are my God, and the rock of my salvation!"
 mann_events.5.b: "May the gods be praised, and may the Allfather guide us!"
