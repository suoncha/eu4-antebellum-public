 ab_the_pheonix_prince.1.d:0 "Years ago, the Byzantine Empire and the Serbian principality were unfortunate allies, standing together against the Bulgarian menace. However, Bulgarian forces emerged victorious, shattering the alliance and leaving both Byzantium and Serbia significantly weaker. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Ioannes II of Byzantium, burdened by the weight of his crumbling empire and the absence of an heir, recognized the need to reestablish the Serbo-Byzantine alliance. He cast his gaze northward, to the Serbian lands, where Princess  [Root.Consort.GetName] was known for her wisdom and grace. Their marriage was a strategic decision, a pact to mend the frayed ties between their realms. It was a union rooted in diplomacy, but beneath the political calculations, a genuine bond began to form between the royal couple. Despite the years that passed, their hope for an heir remained unfulfilled, casting a shadow over the empire's future.\n\nIt is a clear night, and the stars above shine brilliantly, as if the heavens themselves are watching over the city. But then, an extraordinary event starts to unfold. High above, the sky bursts into a spectacular meteor shower, streaks of light and fire trailing across the celestial canvas. As the meteors continue to streak across the sky, in the great palace of Constantinople, the prayers of  [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Ioannes and [Root.Consort.GetTitle]  [Root.Consort.GetName] are finally answered. After a gruelling long pregnancy [Root.Consort.GetTitle]  [Root.Consort.GetName], her eyes reflecting the brilliance of the celestial display outside, finally gives birth to a son.\n\nThe palace is filled with joy, and the news spreads through the city like wildfire. Bells ring out in celebration, and the people, under the meteor shower above, rejoice in the birth of their future ruler. The child, born on this blessed night under the light of the falling stars, is named Alexios. It is seen as a sign, a union of destiny and the heavens. Alexios will grow to be a symbol of hope and renewal, the phoenix, a beacon of promise for the Byzantine Empire, which longs for a future bathed in the light of a new era. "

 ab_the_pheonix_prince.1.b:0 "Exile him to Serbia!"

 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.t:0 "Pheonix Ascendant"
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.d:0 "Alexios Angelos of the Byzantine Empire grew up to embody everything his Angelid ancestors had failed to be. He was a young man driven by an insatiable thirst for all matters concerning rulership. While most of his peers were occupied with pursuits of leisure, he was deeply invested in the arts of warfare and statecraft. He could often be found engrossed in discussions with seasoned generals and advisors, meticulously studying historical records of efficient bureaucracies, immersing himself in the art of diplomacy, poring over battle maps, and thoroughly examining military treatises. His days followed a routine of rigorous physical and mental training. He relentlessly drilled alongside his soldiers, pushing his limits in combat exercises. His proficiency with a sword and his ability to lead by example were renowned throughout the empire.\n\nHis true potential shone brightest in the war room, surrounded by maps, scrolls, and tactical diagrams, where he crafted intricate battle plans. Like the great imperial commanders of the past, he possessed a rare gift for visualising the ebb and flow of a battle, anticipating enemy movements, and exploiting weaknesses.\n\nWhile he was a devoted military strategist, he also had a unique bond with his Serbian mother and her homeland. In private, he cherished the traditions and heritage of Serbia, quietly practising customs passed down through his maternal lineage. His mother's stories of Serbia's history and martial traditions, though less refined than Byzantine ones, nevertheless left a lasting imprint on him. However, his strong attachment to Serbian culture occasionally made him appear aloof or distant from his Byzantine peers, contributing to a sense of isolation within the imperial court.\n\nThis familial connection inspired him to experiment with the incorporation of Serbian military tactics into the Byzantine arsenal. Drawing from the rich martial heritage of both cultures, he sought to meld the strengths of Serbian warfare with Byzantine strategies, creating a distinctive blend that set him apart as a forward-thinking commander. This fusion of traditions not only reinforced his deep connection to his Serbian heritage but also enriched the Byzantine military, providing an innovative edge on the battlefield.\n\nAs word of his unparalleled expertise in warfare spread, he earned the reverence and envy of Byzantium's most seasoned generals. However, within the imperial court, he faced a unique challenge. Some among the courtiers harboured lingering distrust toward him, associating him with the memory of the late rebel leader, Leon Gabras."

 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.b:0 "It is too dangerous, we can't risk losing him."
 ab_the_pheonix_prince.2.c:0 "Our army already shows improvement."
