 lit_infiltrate_title:0 "Infiltrate Livonia" 
 lit_infiltrate_desc:0 "The upstart Dukes of Livonia refuse to recognize our right to rule over all of the Baltic. While we could just march straight into Livonia and conquer it by force, it would be wiser to do some reconnaissance. Once we have charted the best path to Valmiera, we will strike!" 
 lit_centralize_title:0 "Centralise the Duchy" 
 lit_centralize_desc:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] leases out large swathes of land to lesser dukes to ease the burden of ruling, but this has left us weak with no way to enforce our will on our subjects. Lithuania will be centralised once more under one strong [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]." 
 lit_secure_livonia_title:0 "Secure Livonia" 
 lit_secure_livonia_desc:0 "With the duchies reintegrated and the spy network in place, the time has come to fully reunite the Lithuanian lands. The [LVA.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] will hang for their rebelliousness and Livonia will become a permanent part of Lithuania." 
 lit_seize_riga_title:0 "Conquer Riga" 
 lit_seize_riga_desc:0 "The Archbishopric of Riga is a crusader state established not too long ago to spread the light of Catholicism to the Baltics. Fortunately, their mission was a failure and now they exist as a small Hanseatic city surrounded by Lithuania. Germans have no home in the Baltics, and we will kindly show them the way out." 
 lit_west_title:0 "Encroach on the Crusaders" 
 lit_west_desc:0 "Early successes against Pruthenia have resulted in a surge of morale for our armies. The crusaders are eyeing up the Pruthenian land and we must act quickly to prevent them from becoming too powerful. Once Pruthenia is under our control, the Prussians are next." 
 lit_seize_danzig_title:0 "Seize Gdanskas" 
 lit_seize_danzig_desc:0 "The last remaining crusader state in the Baltic is the Republic of Danzig, who claim the entirety of Pruthenia as theirs. This once proud Romuva city is now a city of decadence ruled by the Barbarous Germans, loyal only to money and nothing else. The light of the Romuva faith must be restored to Gdanskas and the Germans evicted." 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_title:0 "Defeat Pruthenia" 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_desc:0 "Pruthenia to our west is the only other real Romuva power in the Baltic. Sadly, their failure to reconquer Gdanskas from the German crusaders proves they are too incompetent to remain independent. To prevent any further success from the crusaders, Pruthenia must be taught a lesson." 
 lit_future_title:0 "The Future of our Nation" 
 lit_future_desc:0 "The Baltics are united, our foes have been defeated and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s central authority has been asserted. Now the question remains of what will Lithuania become? Lithuania could stick to her roots, uniting all the Pagans together under one flag to resist the onslaught of Christians from east and west. Lithuania could pursue a closer relationship with the Orthodox Rus to the east, and work together to defeat the Mongol threat. Or perhaps Lithuania could accept the ways of the Crusaders, and fulfil the goal of the Baltic Crusades and destroy Paganism in Europe." 
 lit_unite_baltic_title:0 "Unite the Baltics" 
 lit_unite_baltic_desc:0 "The last remaining roadblock in our way towards Baltic domination is the Suomenusko Duchy of Estonia. While religiously and culturally different from us, they still share the Baltic Heritage that the Lithuanians and the Pruthenians share. They will love to be part of our growing Duchy." 
 lit_konigsberg_title:0 "Found Karaliaucius" 
 lit_konigsberg_desc:0 "The Pruthenian city of Tvanskte is the perfect location for a new capital of our realm. Located right on the amber coast and along the path of major trade routes, it would be foolish not to locate the Lithuanian realm around it. Karaliaucius will become the city of cities in the Baltic." 
 lit_forest_title:0 "Clear the Forested Areas" 
 lit_forest_desc:0 "Much of our land is vast forest that is not suitable for development. To continue our expansion, we need to chop down as many trees as possible to construct bigger and bigger cities across Lithuania. Surely nobody will miss a few trees in a few hundred years or so." 
 lit_marshes_title:0 "Tame the Marshes" 
 lit_marshes_desc:0 "Another major issue with Lithuania is the sheer amount of marshes that spread across our land. The terrain is unfavourable for humans and clearing marsh is not cheap in any way. But we must persevere to ensure that our people can expand and prosper. The Marshes of Lithuania will bow to our industrial might and make way for new cities across the land." 
 lit_countryside_title:0 "Develop the Countryside" 
 lit_countryside_desc:0 "As much as we would hate to admit it, Lithuania is a poor realm compared to those of the west and east. Our lack of centralization and development has resulted in a disunified and poor population of farmers. Clearly, something has to be done to overcome this. The first step is to expand the farming countryside so there will be food to support growing Lithuanian cities." 
 lit_seat_title:0 "Seat of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]" 
 lit_seat_desc:0 "Every great empire has a famous capital. Rome and Constantinople for the Romans, Babylon for Alexander, Aachen for the Franks, yet Lithuania has no grand capital to call her own. While it will be costly, the capital of Lithuania must be developed and funded to mark our place in history as one of the empires to exist." 
 lit_pirates_title:0 "Deal with the Pirates" 
 lit_pirates_desc:0 "The pirates in Gotland constantly raid the entirety of the Baltic. If we truly are the masters of the Baltic, then they must go, once and for all. Gotland will bend the knee to Lithuania, and we are sure a few pirates would gladly serve us and raid our rivals." 
 lit_monopolize_title:0 "Musu Jura" 
 lit_monopolize_desc:0 "The Roman Empire had the Mediterranean as their own personal sea, trade flowed from Hispania to the black sea unimpeded. The continual growth of our navy has given us the opportunity to make the Baltic our own sea. From Finland to Pruthenia, Lithuania will rule the seas!" 
 lit_ports_title:0 "Baltic Trade Ports" 
 lit_ports_desc:0 "Just owning a merchant fleet does not mean we will gain all the benefits of trade. Foreign merchants still need somewhere to stop and trade if we want to profit from them. Developing small coastal towns into thriving trade cities will propel Lithuania into the future as a major trade player across the Baltic."
 lit_merchant_title:0 "Build a Merchant Fleet" 
 lit_merchant_desc:0 "Trade is necessary for any emerging state to thrive. Without it, we might not have the wealth to expand into our neighbours. To help ensure our traders have a fighting chance against the Hanseatic league and other Baltic naval powers, we need to construct a merchant fleet to support them. If not, we might not ever reach our full potential." 
 lit_amber_title:0 "Restore the Amber Road" 
 lit_amber_desc:0 "In ancient times, merchants from the Mediterranean and further south would travel up to the Baltic to purchase amber from the Balts. While it has been some time since the road has been used, we still possess a large quantity of amber to trade. A new series of roadways will be constructed across Lithuania to promote the amber trade once again." 
 lit_lechitic_title:0 "Lechitic Conquest" 
 lit_lechitic_desc:0 "The Polish to the south have been split for centuries, and their struggle for reunification has yet to finish. This is the perfect opportunity for Lithuania to expand without much resistance from another major power. Poland will make a fine addition to the ever growing collection of cultures under the Lithuanian Flag."
 lit_eliminate_novgorod_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Eliminate Novgorod[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_eliminate_novgorod_desc:0 "The fury of the Romuva shall be unleashed, and our first target shall be our biggest rival to the east, Novgorod. Conquering their capital and coast will forever banish them into irrelevance and begin our ascension as a pagan superpower!" 
 lit_white_sea_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Secure the White Sea[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_white_sea_desc:0 "The frigid waters of the white sea rarely sees any trade, but the Novgorodians have been focusing on developing a trade city to help promote trade in these desolate waters. Luckily, they are in no position to stop us from seizing this new trade port for ourselves." 
 lit_rival_sweden_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Rival Sweden[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_rival_sweden_desc:0 "Other than Novgorod, the only Christian power that threatens us in the Baltic is the crusader kingdom of Sweden. If we dawdle too much, they might become too powerful for us to handle. Constructing an invasion fleet to land in Stockholm and evict the crusaders is paramount to our goals." 
 lit_finland_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Conquer Finland[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_finland_desc:0 "The Finns are a proud people who have resisted every attempt at subjugation against them. Neither the Russians to the east or the Swedes to the west could conquer them. But it takes a pagan to conquer a pagan, and the Finns will love being a part of our empire." 
 lit_recruit_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Recruit the Hakkapeliitta[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_recruit_desc:0 "The Finns, while living in one of the coldest environments on Earth, have developed spectacular light cavalry tactics. Their ability to harass and flank their enemies while also serving as frontline horsemen makes them incredibly valuable to any general. It would be a major mistake to treat the Finns as second class citizens and deny ourselves these amazing soldiers." 
 lit_purge_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Purge the Christians[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_purge_desc:0 "The Catholic Swedes are an atrocity to every paganin the Baltic. Their need to proselytize their beliefs by peace or force has only weakened the Baltics, and now we must undo their damage. Every Swede will learn the light of our holy Romuva faith, or die by our sword." 
 lit_norway_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Unite with Norway[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_norway_desc:0 "The Norse and Romuva gods are not so different deep down. Perhaps there was once a common belief that diverged, or perhaps we simply want more land. Whatever the answer is, the shipwrights of Norway are the most renowned in the world, and bringing them into our fold will benefit both parties." 
 lit_toll_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Control the Sound Toll[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_toll_desc:0 "The time has come, the most crucial toll in all of Europe has long been under the hands of the Danish. Their continual influence over the Baltic ends today. Once the Sound Toll is under our control, all the trade in the Baltic will flow through us, making Lithuania fabulously wealthy." 
 lit_baltoscandia_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Unite Baltoscandia[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_baltoscandia_desc:0 "At first, the Baltic was united under our banner. Every Lithuanian, Pruthenian, Estonia, and Livonian rejoiced. But we did not sit idly on our laurels. We pushed further, kicking the Christians both east and west out and united all the remaining pagans in Europe. Now, we haunt Europe as a spectre of the pagan past. The glorious lands of Baltia and Scandinavia stand as one, Baltoscandia will dominate the North Atlantic forever!"
 lit_control_pomerania_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Subjugate Pomerania[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_control_pomerania_desc:0 "The Wendish have resisted German crusaders for the past few centuries, their tenacity and dedication only proves how capable of a people they are. Sadly, they can not resist the Germans forever, but we can help them. Lithuania shall rule over the Wendish and ensure that their culture and faith never fades into history." 
 lit_destroy_hansa_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Destroy Hansa[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_destroy_hansa_desc:0 "The Hanseatic League is the root of all of our problems in the Baltic. Their constant trade embargos and invasive trade cities attempt to subvert pagan power in the region. Taking their two most important cities of Lübeck and Hamburg will finally deal the finishing blow to the League, and bring peace and prosperity to our new empire." 
 lit_bane_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Bane of the Teutons[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_bane_desc:0 "The Germans pride themselves on their military prowess, but they have clearly shown nothing but incompetence and failure for the past few centuries. Their so called grand crusades and eastward push resulted in very little land conquered from the pagans. We will show them what true military ingenuity and power looks like, and burn down their pathetic empire." 
 lit_raiders_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Raiders on the Storm[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_raiders_desc:0 "The temporary employment of former Raiders from Gotland resulted in a massive increase in profits thanks to their raiding expertise. Sadly, most of these Gutnish raiders have died out or retired, and the Christians are starting to sleep soundly at night again. We should analyse what made them so effective, and then apply it to our newly formed raider group." 
 lit_temples_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Shrines of the Old Gods[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_temples_desc:0 "The Baltic pantheon has been the official state religion ever since the reunification of Lithuania not so long ago. Most of the population practice the faith personally at home. This has created the issue of minor deviations between cities over just what each god represents. State sponsored shrines and temples run by an organised clergy will teach our people in the proper ways to practise our faith." 
 lit_reconciliation_title:0 "[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT]Pagan Reconciliation[Root.GetPreviewColorAB_LIT_end]" 
 lit_reconciliation_desc:0 "The pagan faiths of the north all share some similar practices and beliefs. While this is not enough to justify united all the faiths into one, it is enough for us to tolerate them. One thing we all do share in common is our hatred for Christians and their constant Proselytising and crusades. We will tolerate the other pantheons of gods; and in return, they will give us their finest warriors to slaughter the Christians."

This will be a challenge as in the past we have mostly tolerated our people's religions but that will now change. The Romuva and other pagans will have no refuge here. And for those who flee south seeking refuge and safety in other nations of the faith, they will soon find our armies marching towards them."

Our lands encompass not only Lithuanians, Byelorussians, Latvians, and other groups as well. However, these languages are not too different from each other, so our ruler had the brilliant idea to have the scholars of the nation work on codifying a new language, taking inspiration from all three to be used in matters of state and day to day conversation. a language, not of the Lithuanians or any other singular group but of the Litvins."

First we fought to conquer the other Baltic states, then we addressed the matter of faith and the identity of our people. Afterwards came the conquest of most of Ruthenia, then even further east, into the Ural mountains and to the South into Cossack lands. We are now more powerful than the Rus' ever was! bastion of Orthodox Christianity! However our work is not done yet, we cannot revel in this victory whilst there are still meddling princes plotting against us. All of Ruthenia will bend the knee to it's true masters and when that happens, the Tsardom of Litvinia will be born!"

Great warriors, with their own way of life that follows the Orthodox faith, living off of what their land gives them and fighting tooth and nail against those who try to take their land. These men and their fighting spirit would do wonders for our army and as such we should convince as many of them as we can to enlist in our army."

From its founding as a viking outpost centuries ago, Kijevas has rapidly grown, with no other city matching its power. As the capital of the titular Kievan Rus, the city also grew to possess a symbolic role as the cultural hub of the Eastern Slavs. However, with its sack by the Mongols, the area was devastated, and much of its splendour was ruined. But with the Mongol retreat allowing it to grow, Kijevas has once again risen to prominence, and its strategic position is undeniable too.

This den of schismatics has long been tolerated due to the Westerners' preoccupation with the Pagans, but our conversion has allowed the Crusades to extend farther than ever before. By uprooting this outpost of idol-worshipping heretics we can finally bring Novgorod into the holy Church, or at least make some profit from taking over their valuable trade connections."

With the partial retreat of the latest Nomadic invaders of the Mongols, the region is largely unguarded. We should strive to secure this vital chokepoint for ourselves, both to curtail the unruly Cossacks and protect Christendom from any future Eastern threats."

Let us invite the Patriarch of Kijevas, who administers the eastern rite to all faithful Rus, into our land, so that he may work in peace and stability."
 ltv_second:0 "Recruit the Druzhina"
 ltv_second_desc:0 "It was the Druzhina that traditionally formed the armoured core of the Rus Princes' armies. Now that we rule the traditional lands of Rus, we can prove our legitimacy by enlisting displaced Druzhina."
 ltv_third:0 "Conquest of Rus'"
 ltv_third_desc:0 "Upon our adoption of the true faith, we claimed responsibility for reunifying the disparate principalities within the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Kijevas. Thus, the lands of Rus must be ruled by the Litvin [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 ltv_fourth:0 "Adopt the Cyrillic Script"
 ltv_fourth_desc:0 "The Cyrillic Script is used by speakers of various slavic languages, including the Rus, whom we now rule over. In order to ensure positive relations and ease of communication with our subjects, we should record our own language in Cyrillic as well."
 ltv_fifth:0 "Life-Long Conscription"
 ltv_fifth_desc:0 "The Royal Litvin army shall differ from the forces of our rivals in that our soldiers will serve for life. The tradition of tribal warriorship rooted in our past shall not die with our Christianization, and one of the aspects of this tradition is a lifetime of war."
 ltv_sixth:0 "Enlist the Cossacks"
 ltv_sixth_desc:0 "The Cossacks are semi-nomadic bands of horse-mounted Rus living in the southern and eastern frontiers of Ruthenia. Their unparalleled skill on horseback and remarkable perseverance will make them excellent auxiliary cavalry units in our army."
 ltv_seventh:0 "The Balto-Slavic Tradition"
 ltv_seventh_desc:0 "Over the decades, the kingdom of Litvina has developed a unique culture that synthesises aspects of Baltic and Slavic societies. This amicability between diverse groups has created a multi-ethnic patriotism held by all citizens of our Kingdom. Each man in our realm, from Vilnius to Kijevas, is willing to lay down his life for the crown."

It was made not of stone, but knowledge - knowledge eroded today, but not completely forgotten. It carried not men, but amber - a coveted good eras ago. If we could restore this network, it could carry much more than amber and reach much farther than the Mediterranean..."

Such is absolutism - and such is the way of God."
 lit_federation:0 "Balto-Scandinavian Federation"
 lit_federation_desc:0 "For centuries now, the Christian world has wrought havoc upon the Pagan world. Not only have our ancient woods been encroached upon, roots upheaved and desecrated, but so have the olden mountains of Scandinavia, riddled as they are with foreign barbarians. Funnily enough, it seems we have more in common with those so-called barbarians than we do with Christians - perhaps it would be best to welcome our fellow Pagans under our banner."

 ab_lithuania.1.t:0 "The Future of our Nation"
 ab_lithuania.1.d:0 "After our unification and conquest of our surrounding neighbours, every prominent aristocrat was invited to the capital to debate the future of Lithuania. From our homelands are the Romuvans who wish to keep true to the old faith and unite all other pagans against the armies of Christ. From the Polish lands are nobles and priests who claim there is much to be had in Catholicism, and that the Pope is willing to grant us many boons to convert. Finally, Ruthenians and other Eastern Slavs claim that the best course of action is to be baptised under Orthodoxy to help rule our new eastern lands. Whatever the choice, it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide our future."

Now, we are united as one against our common enemy. We will be crowned as Emperor of Baltoscandia and lead our own crusade against the Christians.

No longer shall disencouraged Orthodox followers look towards the failing Caesars in East Rome. Instead, we shall claim the mantle of Caesardom for ourselves.

Every pagan or heretic that has gotten in our way has fallen, and now we hold a vast empire in the east. The Pope has called upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grant them a new title worthy of their rank.
