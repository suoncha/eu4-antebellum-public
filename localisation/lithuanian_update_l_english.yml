 lit_infiltrate_title:0 "Infiltrate Livonia" 
 lit_infiltrate_desc:0 "The upstart Dukes of Livonia refuse to recognize our right to rule over all of the Baltic. While we could just march straight into Livonia and conquer it by force, it would be wiser to do some reconnaissance. Once we have charted the best path to Valmiera, we will strike!" 
 lit_centralize_title:0 "Centralise the Duchy" 
 lit_centralize_desc:0 "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] leases out large swathes of land to lesser dukes to ease the burden of ruling, but this has left us weak with no way to enforce our will on our subjects. Lithuania will be centralised once more under one strong [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]." 
 lit_secure_livonia_title:0 "Secure Livonia" 
 lit_secure_livonia_desc:0 "With the duchies reintegrated and the spy network in place, the time has come to fully reunite the Lithuanian lands. The [LVA.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] will hang for their rebelliousness and Livonia will become a permanent part of Lithuania." 
 lit_seize_riga_title:0 "Conquer Riga" 
 lit_seize_riga_desc:0 "The Archbishopric of Riga is a crusader state established not too long ago to spread the light of Catholicism to the Baltics. Fortunately, their mission was a failure and now they exist as a small Hanseatic city surrounded by Lithuania. Germans have no home in the Baltics, and we will kindly show them the way out." 
 lit_west_title:0 "Encroach on the Crusaders" 
 lit_west_desc:0 "Early successes against Pruthenia have resulted in a surge of morale for our armies. The crusaders are eyeing up the Pruthenian land and we must act quickly to prevent them from becoming too powerful. Once Pruthenia is under our control, the Prussians are next." 
 lit_seize_danzig_title:0 "Seize Gdanskas" 
 lit_seize_danzig_desc:0 "The last remaining crusader state in the Baltic is the Republic of Danzig, who claim the entirety of Pruthenia as theirs. This once proud Romuva city is now a city of decadence ruled by the Barbarous Germans, loyal only to money and nothing else. The light of the Romuva faith must be restored to Gdanskas and the Germans evicted." 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_title:0 "Defeat Pruthenia" 
 lit_defeat_pruthenia_desc:0 "Pruthenia to our west is the only other real Romuva power in the Baltic. Sadly, their failure to reconquer Gdanskas from the German crusaders proves they are too incompetent to remain independent. To prevent any further success from the crusaders, Pruthenia must be taught a lesson." 
 lit_future_title:0 "The Future of our Nation" 
 lit_future_desc:0 "The Baltics are united, our foes have been defeated and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s central authority has been asserted. Now the question remains of what will Lithuania become? Lithuania could stick to her roots, uniting all the Pagans together under one flag to resist the onslaught of Christians from east and west. Lithuania could pursue a closer relationship with the Orthodox Rus to the east, and work together to defeat the Mongol threat. Or perhaps Lithuania could accept the ways of the Crusaders, and fulfil the goal of the Baltic Crusades and destroy Paganism in Europe." 
 lit_unite_baltic_title:0 "Unite the Baltics" 
 lit_unite_baltic_desc:0 "The last remaining roadblock in our way towards Baltic domination is the Suomenusko Duchy of Estonia. While religiously and culturally different from us, they still share the Baltic Heritage that the Lithuanians and the Pruthenians share. They will love to be part of our growing Duchy." 
 lit_konigsberg_title:0 "Found Karaliaucius" 
 lit_konigsberg_desc:0 "The Pruthenian city of Tvanskte is the perfect location for a new capital of our realm. Located right on the amber coast and along the path of major trade routes, it would be foolish not to locate the Lithuanian realm around it. Karaliaucius will become the city of cities in the Baltic." 
 lit_forest_title:0 "Clear the Forested Areas" 
 lit_forest_desc:0 "Much of our land is vast forest that is not suitable for development. To continue our expansion, we need to chop down as many trees as possible to construct bigger and bigger cities across Lithuania. Surely nobody will miss a few trees in a few hundred years or so." 
 lit_marshes_title:0 "Tame the Marshes" 
 lit_marshes_desc:0 "Another major issue with Lithuania is the sheer amount of marshes that spread across our land. The terrain is unfavourable for humans and clearing marsh is not cheap in any way. But we must persevere to ensure that our people can expand and prosper. The Marshes of Lithuania will bow to our industrial might and make way for new cities across the land." 
 lit_countryside_title:0 "Develop the Countryside" 
 lit_countryside_desc:0 "As much as we would hate to admit it, Lithuania is a poor realm compared to those of the west and east. Our lack of centralization and development has resulted in a disunified and poor population of farmers. Clearly, something has to be done to overcome this. The first step is to expand the farming countryside so there will be food to support growing Lithuanian cities." 
 lit_seat_title:0 "Seat of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]" 
 lit_seat_desc:0 "Every great empire has a famous capital. Rome and Constantinople for the Romans, Babylon for Alexander, Aachen for the Franks, yet Lithuania has no grand capital to call her own. While it will be costly, the capital of Lithuania must be developed and funded to mark our place in history as one of the empires to exist." 
 lit_pirates_title:0 "Deal with the Pirates" 
 lit_pirates_desc:0 "The pirates in Gotland constantly raid the entirety of the Baltic. If we truly are the masters of the Baltic, then they must go, once and for all. Gotland will bend the knee to Lithuania, and we are sure a few pirates would gladly serve us and raid our rivals." 
 lit_monopolize_title:0 "Musu Jura" 
 lit_monopolize_desc:0 "The Roman Empire had the Mediterranean as their own personal sea, trade flowed from Hispania to the black sea unimpeded. The continual growth of our navy has given us the opportunity to make the Baltic our own sea. From Finland to Pruthenia, Lithuania will rule the seas!" 
 lit_ports_title:0 "Baltic Trade Ports" 
 lit_ports_desc:0 "Just owning a merchant fleet does not mean we will gain all the benefits of trade. Foreign merchants still need somewhere to stop and trade if we want to profit from them. Developing small coastal towns into thriving trade cities will propel Lithuania into the future as a major trade player across the Baltic."
 lit_merchant_title:0 "Build a Merchant Fleet" 
 lit_merchant_desc:0 "Trade is necessary for any emerging state to thrive. Without it, we might not have the wealth to expand into our neighbours. To help ensure our traders have a fighting chance against the Hanseatic league and other Baltic naval powers, we need to construct a merchant fleet to support them. If not, we might not ever reach our full potential." 
 lit_amber_title:0 "Restore the Amber Road" 
 lit_amber_desc:0 "In ancient times, merchants from the Mediterranean and further south would travel up to the Baltic to purchase amber from the Balts. While it has been some time since the road has been used, we still possess a large quantity of amber to trade. A new series of roadways will be constructed across Lithuania to promote the amber trade once again." 
 lit_lechitic_title:0 "Lechitic Conquest" 
 lit_lechitic_desc:0 "The Polish to the south have been split for centuries, and their struggle for reunification has yet to finish. This is the perfect opportunity for Lithuania to expand without much resistance from another major power. Poland will make a fine addition to the ever growing collection of cultures under the Lithuanian Flag."
 lit_eliminate_novgorod_title:0 "Eliminate Novgorod" 
 lit_eliminate_novgorod_desc:0 "The fury of the Romuva shall be unleashed, and our first target shall be our biggest rival to the east, Novgorod. Conquering their capital and coast will forever banish them into irrelevance and begin our ascension as a pagan superpower!" 
 lit_white_sea_title:0 "Secure the White Sea" 
 lit_white_sea_desc:0 "The frigid waters of the white sea rarely sees any trade, but the Novgorodians have been focusing on developing a trade city to help promote trade in these desolate waters. Luckily, they are in no position to stop us from seizing this new trade port for ourselves." 
 lit_rival_sweden_title:0 "Rival Sweden" 
 lit_rival_sweden_desc:0 "Other than Novgorod, the only Christian power that threatens us in the Baltic is the crusader kingdom of Sweden. If we dawdle too much, they might become too powerful for us to handle. Constructing an invasion fleet to land in Stockholm and evict the crusaders is paramount to our goals." 
 lit_finland_title:0 "Conquer Finland" 
 lit_finland_desc:0 "The Finns are a proud people who have resisted every attempt at subjugation against them. Neither the Russians to the east or the Swedes to the west could conquer them. But it takes a pagan to conquer a pagan, and the Finns will love being a part of our empire." 
 lit_recruit_title:0 "Recruit the Hakkapeliitta" 
 lit_recruit_desc:0 "The Finns, while living in one of the coldest environments on Earth, have developed spectacular light cavalry tactics. Their ability to harass and flank their enemies while also serving as frontline horsemen makes them incredibly valuable to any general. It would be a major mistake to treat the Finns as second class citizens and deny ourselves these amazing soldiers." 
 lit_purge_title:0 "Purge the Christians" 
 lit_purge_desc:0 "The Catholic Swedes are an atrocity to every paganin the Baltic. Their need to proselytize their beliefs by peace or force has only weakened the Baltics, and now we must undo their damage. Every Swede will learn the light of our holy Romuva faith, or die by our sword." 
 lit_norway_title:0 "Unite with Norway" 
 lit_norway_desc:0 "The Norse and Romuva gods are not so different deep down. Perhaps there was once a common belief that diverged, or perhaps we simply want more land. Whatever the answer is, the shipwrights of Norway are the most renowned in the world, and bringing them into our fold will benefit both parties." 
 lit_toll_title:0 "Control the Sound Toll" 
 lit_toll_desc:0 "The time has come, the most crucial toll in all of Europe has long been under the hands of the Danish. Their continual influence over the Baltic ends today. Once the Sound Toll is under our control, all the trade in the Baltic will flow through us, making Lithuania fabulously wealthy." 
 lit_baltoscandia_title:0 "Unite Baltoscandia" 
 lit_baltoscandia_desc:0 "At first, the Baltic was united under our banner. Every Lithuanian, Pruthenian, Estonia, and Livonian rejoiced. But we did not sit idly on our laurels. We pushed further, kicking the Christians both east and west out and united all the remaining pagans in Europe. Now, we haunt Europe as a spectre of the pagan past. The glorious lands of Baltia and Scandinavia stand as one, Baltoscandia will dominate the North Atlantic forever!"
 lit_control_pomerania_title:0 "Subjugate Pomerania" 
 lit_control_pomerania_desc:0 "The Wendish have resisted German crusaders for the past few centuries, their tenacity and dedication only proves how capable of a people they are. Sadly, they can not resist the Germans forever, but we can help them. Lithuania shall rule over the Wendish and ensure that their culture and faith never fades into history." 
 lit_destroy_hansa_title:0 "Destroy Hansa" 
 lit_destroy_hansa_desc:0 "The Hanseatic League is the root of all of our problems in the Baltic. Their constant trade embargos and invasive trade cities attempt to subvert pagan power in the region. Taking their two most important cities of Lübeck and Hamburg will finally deal the finishing blow to the League, and bring peace and prosperity to our new empire." 
 lit_bane_title:0 "Bane of the Teutons" 
 lit_bane_desc:0 "The Germans pride themselves on their military prowess, but they have clearly shown nothing but incompetence and failure for the past few centuries. Their so called grand crusades and eastward push resulted in very little land conquered from the pagans. We will show them what true military ingenuity and power looks like, and burn down their pathetic empire." 
 lit_raiders_title:0 "Raiders on the Storm" 
 lit_raiders_desc:0 "The temporary employment of former Raiders from Gotland resulted in a massive increase in profits thanks to their raiding expertise. Sadly, most of these Gutnish raiders have died out or retired, and the Christians are starting to sleep soundly at night again. We should analyse what made them so effective, and then apply it to our newly formed raider group." 
 lit_temples_title:0 "Shrines of the Old Gods" 
 lit_temples_desc:0 "The Baltic pantheon has been the official state religion ever since the reunification of Lithuania not so long ago. Most of the population practice the faith personally at home. This has created the issue of minor deviations between cities over just what each god represents. State sponsored shrines and temples run by an organised clergy will teach our people in the proper ways to practise our faith." 
 lit_reconciliation_title:0 "Pagan Reconciliation" 
 lit_reconciliation_desc:0 "The pagan faiths of the north all share some similar practices and beliefs. While this is not enough to justify united all the faiths into one, it is enough for us to tolerate them. One thing we all do share in common is our hatred for Christians and their constant Proselytising and crusades. We will tolerate the other pantheons of gods; and in return, they will give us their finest warriors to slaughter the Christians."

 lit_complete_conversion_title:0 "Complete the Conversion"
 lit_complete_conversion_desc:0 "We have stated our intention to follow the Orthodox faith, as such, we must work to convert those in our lands who do not see lord Christ as their saviour, nor wish to. This will be a challenge as in the past we have mostly tolerated our people's religions but that will now change. The Romuva and other pagans will have no refuge here. And for those who flee south seeking refuge and safety in other nations of the faith, they will soon find our armies marching towards them."
 lit_cultural_title:0 "Cultural Assimilation"
 lit_cultural_desc:0 "With the people of our lands now following the one true faith, now arises the need to address the different languages spoken within our lands. Our lands encompass not only Lithuanians, Byelorussians, Latvians, and other groups as well. However, these languages are not too different from each other, so our ruler had the brilliant idea to have the scholars of the nation work on codifying a new language, taking inspiration from all three to be used in matters of state and day to day conversation. a language, not of the Lithuanians or any other singular group but of the Litvins."
 lit_invade_rus_title:0 "Invade Ruthenia"
 lit_invade_rus_desc:0 "With the most important internal matters of the nation addressed, our people now dream of more conquests and the fragmented Rus' seems ideal for this. Once united under a single banner, it shattered before the might of the Mongols and it hasn't been able to unite since those days. If the Ruthenians are unable to consolidate their own state, why shouldn't we dream of one day conquering the entirety of Ruthenia?"
 lit_secure_novgorod_title:0 "Secure Novgorod"
 lit_secure_novgorod_desc:0 "Novgorod is one of the most important cities in Eastern Europe, from its role as a major trade hub to the grandeur of its cathedrals and the role it played in teaching the princes of the Kievan Rus' how to rule, Novgorod is a city that has few superiors. Its conquest will bring wealth to our people and serve as a springboard to even greater things."
 lit_legacy_title:0 "Legacy of Kievan Rus"
 lit_legacy_desc:0 "Ruthenia's princes show little resistance to our conquest, that much has been made clear with our conquest of Minsk and it's surrounding areas, our ambition of one day ruling over the entirety of the former Rus' lands seems more and more likely to be realised. We should press our advantage and continue our expansion whilst we still can. We are the successors to the Rus'! And we will earn that title by Right of conquest!"
 lit_new_tsardom_title:0 "A New Tsardom"
 lit_new_tsardom_desc:0 "Litvinia has come far from its humble beginnings as Lithuania. First we fought to conquer the other Baltic states, then we addressed the matter of faith and the identity of our people. Afterwards came the conquest of most of Ruthenia, then even further east, into the Ural mountains and to the South into Cossack lands. We are now more powerful than the Rus' ever was! bastion of Orthodox Christianity! However our work is not done yet, we cannot revel in this victory whilst there are still meddling princes plotting against us. All of Ruthenia will bend the knee to it's true masters and when that happens, the Tsardom of Litvinia will be born!"
 lit_cossacks_title:0 "Accommodate the Cossacks"
 lit_cossacks_desc:0 "The cossacks living in the southern steppes are remarkable people. Great warriors, with their own way of life that follows the Orthodox faith, living off of what their land gives them and fighting tooth and nail against those who try to take their land. These men and their fighting spirit would do wonders for our army and as such we should convince as many of them as we can to enlist in our army."
 lit_ural_title:0 "Reach the Urals"
 lit_ural_desc:0 "The lands of Eastern Ruthenia's greatest weakness is their lack of protection from attacks from the east, this was most evident with the Mongols, however, left unchecked this will quickly become a problem for our kingdom. Whilst not the easiest, pushing all the way to the Urals would be the best solution, a way to guarantee our flank is covered by natural defences and should the opportunity come, will even allow our people to settle beyond the mountains in the future."
 lit_finnish_frontier_title:0 "The Finnish Frontier"
 lit_finnish_frontier_desc:0 "The conquest of Novgorod allows us to push northwest into Finnish lands, its people follow a faith completely different from ours and worse yet, the land's extremely harsh conditions will pose as much of a challenge to us as any army will. However the conquest of Finland will bring one benefit to us, it'll be our line of defence against the Swedish heretics, a military frontier against the catholics."
 lit_mother_title:0 "The Mother of All Cities"
 lit_mother_desc:0 "Kijevas is not the city it once was, at its peak, it had no equal in all of Ruthenia, it's citizens were educated, it's markets filled with goods from both Varangians and the Byzantines, the passage of time has not been kind to it, but we can restore it. Build new churches and infrastructure in the city and return it to its place as the mother of all cities."
 lit_bread_title:0 "Breadbasket of Europe"
 lit_bread_desc:0 "The lands of Ruthenia contain some of the most fertile soil in Europe, however despite this fact, much of this soil has been mismanaged, with production not reaching the heights that it should, therefore stunting population growth. The situation needs to change for the good of the nation."
 lit_westernise_navy_title:0 "Westernise the Shipbuilding"
 lit_westernise_navy_desc:0 "Over the course of the decades, the port of Visby has seen many ships arrive and depart from its docks. Lately though, it is as if with every year, the ships from Western Europe travel faster and faster. It has become apparent that their naval technology far surpasses our own, both currently and in speed of development and we should implement measures to counter this trend."
 lit_baptize_poland_title:0 "Crown of Lendia"
 lit_baptize_poland_desc:0 "Our new polish subjects have been granted the freedom to practise their own culture, however, many of them use this fact as an excuse to keep practising not only Catholicism but other pagan faiths as well. These actions need to be corrected immediately. We will create a puppet king to act as our right hand in the region."
 lit_moravian_intervention_title:0 "Moravian Intervention"
 lit_moravian_intervention_desc:0 "The lands of Moravia are rich ones, with plenty of productive farmlands and vast mineral deposits. However there's also plenty of mountains and the impressive fortress of Veligrad. Its conquest will be tough but our armies will come out stronger and better prepared for other conflicts."
 lit_wendia_title:0 "Christianise Wendia"
 lit_wendia_desc:0 "Wendia is the last region where the old Slavic faith is still practised, its people one of the last ones in Europe who still do not see any form of Christianity as their salvation, instead relying on false gods for their 'protection'. Let us crush their belief once and for all, to finally prove to them that protection and salvation can only come in the form of Christ."
 
 
 
 litc_mother_title:0 "The Mother of Cities"
 litc_mother_desc:0 "Kijevas has long been regarded as the preeminent city of the Rus. From its founding as a viking outpost centuries ago, Kijevas has rapidly grown, with no other city matching its power. As the capital of the titular Kievan Rus, the city also grew to possess a symbolic role as the cultural hub of the Eastern Slavs. However, with its sack by the Mongols, the area was devastated, and much of its splendour was ruined. But with the Mongol retreat allowing it to grow, Kijevas has once again risen to prominence, and its strategic position is undeniable too. With our own patronage we can rebuild the city to surpass its previous power, and make it our new, shining capital."
 litc_bread_title:0 "Breadbasket of Europe"
 litc_bread_desc:0 "Ruthenia has always been a highly productive agricultural region, but with the Mongol Invasions and the subsequent period of endemic warfare following its prominence has declined as of late. Meanwhile our population has continued to grow, and without a stable source of food we will be forced to rely on expensive and unreliable imports. Therefore, it is of principal interest to us to restore and expand these now half-vacant lands to their true potential, that of one of the most productive granaries in the world."
 litc_westernise_navy_title:0 "Westernise the Shipbuilding"
 litc_westernise_navy_desc:0 "We have learned much from our friends in the Crusaders, but due to our formerly landlocked status we have precious little experience with shipbuilding. By finding an ally who could provide the knowledge and expertise we desperately lack, we could rapidly modernise and expand our navy to compete in the Baltic and beyond."
 litc_baptize_poland_title:0 "Crown of Poland"
 litc_baptize_poland_desc:0 "On the heels of our successful incursion into Poland, and increasing support for our rule across the rest of the region, Poland shall finally unite for the first time in centuries, and under our benevolent rule no less. We shall take the Crown of Poland that now lies shattered and broken and raise it up, ending Poland's long, humiliating division, and bring it under one banner and one faith."
 litc_moravian_intervention_title:0 "Recatholicize Moravia"
 litc_moravian_intervention_desc:0 "Svatopluk of Moravia was the greatest ruler of the Moravians, and under him it could briefly claim greatness. But, his successors turned from the true path and dealt with the treacherous Greeks, who sought to divide the Holy Church and squander its progress. No more! The decadent Moravians have long suffered in their split from his holiness the Pope, and we shall take it upon ourselves to bring them back into the one true church, by force!"
 litc_wendia_title:0 "Christianise Wendia"
 litc_wendia_desc:0 "The Wends have long been a thorn in the side of Christian Europe since the time of Charlemagne, and their continued raids have long threatened the existence of Christendom in the Baltic. We shall do as even the Great King could not, and vanquish the idolaters completely, bringing them under the sway of the one Holy Church."
 litc_complete_conversion_title:0 "Complete the Conversion"
 litc_complete_conversion_desc:0 "Our baptism by the Pope himself may have convinced the elites to follow Christ, but the peasantry remains mostly unaware and uninterested in our new faith. Indeed, many prominent figures in the church have cast doubt on our sincerity, believing we merely converted to appease the Crusaders who long troubled us. But we shall show them our mission is true, our resolve and faith are absolute, and we will show our people the light."
 litc_cultural_title:0 "Cultural Assimilation"
 litc_cultural_desc:0 "With the greater emphasis on our connections to our brethren in the Rus, and their rise to great positions of prominence in our state, our court will become more vibrant and diverse. Ruthenian and Byelorussian dialects are now as common as Lithuanian in the halls of our monarch, and their formal status as equal partners in the state is necessary. Already it seems that something new is emerging. Not quite Lithuanian, but not fully Rus either, the cultural blending in our nation can reach its most brilliant, if only we allow it to grow."
 litc_legacy_title:0 "Legacy of Kievan Rus'"
 litc_legacy_desc:0 "The Kievan Rus was shattered long ago, but its memory remains deeply embedded in the minds of the people. The Mongols even in their death throes have strived to prevent a new power rising in the West, but we shall show them their folly. They could not break us even as they conquered many far-off and powerful lands, and now we will reverse their greatest triumph in Europe. We shall bring order and peace as the successors of the Kievan Rus, and from Kijevas the light that will convert the East shall shine forth."
 litc_invade_rus_title:0 "Invade Ruthenia"
 litc_invade_rus_desc:0 "With our conversion complete and the realm stabilised, we may now turn Eastwards. The lands of the Byelorussians are vulnerable, with the once-mighty Kievan Rus gone. Ruthenia is still recovering from the Mongol onslaught, and thus a prime target for expansion. The power vacuum in the Rus has led to much chaos in Ruthenia, and if we wish to rise as a power we must make a move on Belarus."
 litc_ural_title:0 "Reach Ural"
 litc_ural_desc:0 "With our hold on the greater part of the Rus secure and the claim to the Kievan Rus secured, we must turn further eastwards. The lands North of the Steppes are a diverse place with immense wealth of natural resources. Claiming these bountiful but underutilised lands for ourselves will serve to reinforce our economy, and perhaps set the stage for expansion even further into the unknown East."
 litc_rex_rusiae_title:0 "Rex Russiae"
 litc_rex_rusiae_desc:0 "Now that our claim to the legacy of the Kievan Rus is secure, we must strive for the final unification of all Rus peoples under one nation. With that monumental achievement and the blessing with his holiness the Pope we shall be able to claim the title of not just the Kievan Rus, but something far, far greater."
 litc_secure_novgorod_title:0 "Secure Novgorod"
 litc_secure_novgorod_desc:0 "Secure in our faith, we must continue the mission of the Crusaders to the lands of Novgorod. This den of schismatics has long been tolerated due to the Westerners' preoccupation with the Pagans, but our conversion has allowed the Crusades to extend farther than ever before. By uprooting this outpost of idol-worshipping heretics we can finally bring Novgorod into the holy Church, or at least make some profit from taking over their valuable trade connections."
 litc_finnish_frontier_title:0 "The Finnish Frontier"
 litc_finnish_frontier_desc:0 "The Finns have long been secure in their lands, content to herd and practise their heathenous religion while the Swedes fought the Nordic Pagans to a standstill. We shall take up the cause of a Finnish Crusade and establish for ourselves a bulwark in the North to guard against any attempt at a Pagan incursion Westwards."
 litc_cossacks_title:0 "Tame the Steppes"
 litc_cossacks_desc:0 "The wild fields of the Pontic steppes have long been a springboard for invasions into Central and Eastern Europe. With the partial retreat of the latest Nomadic invaders of the Mongols, the region is largely unguarded. We should strive to secure this vital chokepoint for ourselves, both to curtail the unruly Cossacks and protect Christendom from any future Eastern threats."

 ltv_sixth_desc:0 "The Cossacks are semi-nomadic bands of horse-mounted Rus living in the southern and eastern frontiers of Ruthenia. Their unparalleled skill on horseback and remarkable perseverance will make them excellent auxiliary cavalry units in our army."

 ltv_seventh_desc:0 "Over the decades, the kingdom of Litvina has developed a unique culture that synthesises aspects of Baltic and Slavic societies. This amicability between diverse groups has created a multi-ethnic patriotism held by all citizens of our Kingdom. Each man in our realm, from Vilnius to Kijevas, is willing to lay down his life for the crown."

 ltvc_second:0 "Legacy of the Crusades"
 ltvc_second_desc:0 "Our identity was shaped by Catholic fervour, and the wars that came with it. Our survival is entirely dependent on the strenuous defence of our faith. Deus Vult!"
 ltvc_third:0 "Lithuanian Magnates"
 ltvc_third_desc:0 "Support from the nobility is key in all of our military endeavours; with the aid of the aristocracy, at a moment's notice an army of the people can be deployed in the face of Satan's battalions."
 ltvc_fourth:0 "Papal Blessing"
 ltvc_fourth_desc:0 "Lithuania's first Catholic kings were appointed and crowned by the Pope, whose support for our cause remains unwavering to this day."
 ltvc_fifth:0 "Mending the Schism"
 ltvc_fifth_desc:0 "Clearly the reason for a Great Schism in Christendom is the lack of strength and resolve in those supposed to defend it. By strength alone will we impose upon the heathens and heretics the true will of God."
 ltvc_sixth:0 "Found the University of Vilnius"
 ltvc_sixth_desc:0 "A centre of scholarly learning like few in our region, the University of Vilnius is a staple in our nation's technological advancement. Minds from across Lithuania and all the Baltic come to our capital for the purpose of unravelling the mysteries of the Universe."
 ltvc_seventh:0 "The Balto-Slavic Tradition"
 ltvc_seventh_desc:0 "Having lived together as neighbours, even through our quarrels over matters of faith we've grown to recognize the Slavs as our brothers. So long as we follow Jesus Christ's true word, our customs do little to separate us in the grand scheme of things if we're all fighting for the same thing - the supremacy of God over all of His enemies."

 lit_second_desc:0 "Since ancient times, Baltic warfare has been dominated by the use of convenient fortifications constructed out of already existent hills that dot the landscape. These forts are much cheaper to maintain than castles, and can more easily be deconstructed and rebuilt."
 lit_third_desc:0 "At a crucial junction in Lithuanian history, our great King Mindaugas rejected a papal offer to convert his kingdom to Christianity, instead choosing to maintain the ancestral faith of our people. While this made him a target of Christian hostility, he became an everlasting hero of our nation."

 lit_restore_amber:0 "Restore the Amber Road"
 lit_restore_amber_desc:0 "Millennia ago, a wizened road stretched from the frigid Baltic to the sweetened shores of the Mediterranean. It was made not of stone, but knowledge - knowledge eroded today, but not completely forgotten. It carried not men, but amber - a coveted good eras ago. If we could restore this network, it could carry much more than amber and reach much farther than the Mediterranean..."

 lit_warriors_perkunas_desc:0 "The great Perkunas, god of storms, god of the awesome and destructive phenomena of lightning and thunder, driver and herald of victory, bravery, sky and heavenly fire itself... he is the god that our warriors worship. He is the god that our warriors flock to - not some whimsical, all-encompassing 'father'. No... Perkunas answers our loyalty - and with each victory, our morale and devotion grow stronger."
 lit_new_model:0 "New Order Regiments"
 lit_new_model_desc:0 "Our unique government, our unique culture and our unique position in Europe has allowed us certain advantages but also certain challenges. Logistical challenges unique to our position and strengths arise every day - as a result, our army must take on a composition unmatched, a discipline unmatched and a size unmatched. Quality and quantity must be wielded in equal measure to create a fighting force to match our many enemies."
 lit_crusader_nobility:0 "Crusader Nobility"
 lit_crusader_nobility_desc:0 "It seems only fitting that the nobility within our country be composed of the crusaders which have flocked to our banner. God does good unto those who have done good unto the world - and our diligent crusades have surely brought His word into many a heathen forest. How better to both encourage our crusaders and ensure a supply of future crusaders than by rewarding the men who come our way?"
 lit_spread_cyrillic:0 "Spread the Cyrillic Script"
 lit_spread_cyrillic_desc:0 "Across Eastern Europe, the script of the Bulgarians dominates. Known as Cyrillic, it poses a fierce competition to the likes of the Arabic and Latin scribblings that oftentimes disgrace our eyes. Should we embrace it wholeheartedly, we could integrate our country into the Eastern European region proper and encourage better the spread of new ideas and information."
 lit_power_tsar:0 "All Power to the Tsar"
 lit_power_tsar_desc:0 "Under His word, the Tsar has the power. Likewise, in any worthwhile state, a strong leader is best-suited. A strong leader and a strong, succinct chain of command ensures efficiency, administrative cohesion and a certain atmosphere of dread to those woefully inefficient or unworthy of holding office. Such is absolutism - and such is the way of God."
 lit_federation:0 "Balto-Scandinavian Federation"
 lit_federation_desc:0 "For centuries now, the Christian world has wrought havoc upon the Pagan world. Not only have our ancient woods been encroached upon, roots upheaved and desecrated, but so have the olden mountains of Scandinavia, riddled as they are with foreign barbarians. Funnily enough, it seems we have more in common with those so-called barbarians than we do with Christians - perhaps it would be best to welcome our fellow Pagans under our banner."
 #Events
 ab_lithuania.1.t:0 "The Future of our Nation"
 ab_lithuania.1.d:0 "After our unification and conquest of our surrounding neighbours, every prominent aristocrat was invited to the capital to debate the future of Lithuania. From our homelands are the Romuvans who wish to keep true to the old faith and unite all other pagans against the armies of Christ. From the Polish lands are nobles and priests who claim there is much to be had in Catholicism, and that the Pope is willing to grant us many boons to convert. Finally, Ruthenians and other Eastern Slavs claim that the best course of action is to be baptised under Orthodoxy to help rule our new eastern lands. Whatever the choice, it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide our future."

Now, we are united as one against our common enemy. We will be crowned as Emperor of Baltoscandia and lead our own crusade against the Christians. We will prove that we are greater than the sum of our parts."
 ab_lithuania.2.a:0 "United we stand!"
 ab_lithuania.12.t:0 "A New Tsardom"
 ab_lithuania.12.d:0 "Our continued conquest of Orthodox lands and crusade against the remaining pagans in the Baltics have proven to the world that Litvinia is the new Orthodox superpower. No longer shall disencouraged Orthodox followers look towards the failing Caesars in East Rome. Instead, we shall claim the mantle of Caesardom for ourselves. Our glorious leader will now be known as the Tsar of Litvinia, and the glory of Orthodoxy will spread even further beyond."

 ab_lithuania.13.d:0 "Ever since our Baptism all those years ago, the Pope has kept a close eye on our progress on spreading the true faith eastwards. Every pagan or heretic that has gotten in our way has fallen, and now we hold a vast empire in the east. The Pope has called upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to grant them a new title worthy of their rank. With the crown placed upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head by the Holy Father, they will forever be known as Rex Russiae, King of the Russians."
