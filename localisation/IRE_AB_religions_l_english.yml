 gaelic_ab_flav.1.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Archbishop"
 gaelic_ab_flav.1.d: "The Gaelic Church was founded on both secular and religious differences from the Catholic Church. The primary secular concern was the influence of the mainland within Gaelic politics, to the point that they could decide rulers and enforce rulings upon the Gaelic states from afar, while the religious concern laid in a revival of Celtic and Insular traditions across both Ireland and the Highlands. As such, the Gaelic Church implemented an archbishopric system among the bishops of their state, who’s authority came from God as well as the High Kings, and could better enforce rulings and make decisions for their realm. This tradition is often muddled with corruption and internal struggles, and even though the election of an archbishop is meant to be decided by a series of electors, it is often funded by lords and ladies wishing for political problems to be solved through the words of the pious. Thus, no one knows for sure who will become the archbishop when elected, but it can be assumed that there is some manipulation at play."
