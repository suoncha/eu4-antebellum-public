 slovien_culture_title:0 "Unite the Slovien Nation"
 slovien_culture_desc:0 "When Great Moravia was formed centuries ago, the Slavic tribes which had been living in its core territory had so few differences that they could be easily considered a single tribe. Over time, this sense of cultural unity has disappeared, as the nations have started developing their distinct cultures and languages. If our country is to be a powerful player on the map of Europe, it should be in our best interest to revive the cultural unity among the Slavic tribes living in the heartland of our rising empire."

 england_prison_title:0 "Clear Out the Debtor's Prisons"
 england_prison_desc:0 "Because of, and perhaps contributing to, urban overpopulation, there aren't enough jobs or homes for all of the lower classes. As many of these impoverished labourers have nowhere else to go, they wind up in crippling debt - which they can't repay - and are consequently thrown into debtor's jail for months at a time. Rather than letting this cycle persist, we should perhaps give the destitute and indebted of England a chance at a fresh start in one of our colonies."

 assemble_house_lords2_title:0 "Assemble the House of Lords"
 assemble_house_lords2_desc:0 "The Domesday Book was nothing short of a saving grace for this regime, with administrative functions becoming more efficient by the year. That being said, our aristocracy on both sides of the Channel are more marginalised than is befitting their rank under the current system. Let us assemble a House of Lords, thus allowing them to participate more formally in matters of state as representatives of their subjects."
 assemble_house_lords_title:0 "Assemble the House of Lords"
 assemble_house_lords_desc:0 "The Magna Carta and its consequences have been a disaster for the Anglo-Norman people. If we're to move forward, and overcome our enemies, we must repeal this blight upon the King's Peace. The nobles may be irate at first, but on occasion we must remove the velvet glove and bring down the iron fist. At the very least, the barons will still hold an important place within His Majesty's government as life peers in the House of Lords."
