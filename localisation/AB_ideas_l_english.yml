 frc_second:0 "Reconquest of the Eastern Empire"
 frc_second_desc:0 "The Carolingian dynasty lost the German throne in the early 10th century. The ambitions of our rulers and generals must push us forward so that we may eventually reunite the empire that was broken so many years ago."

 frc_third:0 "Reform the Salic Law"
 frc_third_desc:0 "Salic law provides written codification of both civil law, such as the statutes governing inheritance, and criminal law, such as the punishment for murder. We must reform it to ensure that it is up to date with our rapidly changing society."
 frc_fourth:0 "Carolingian Dynasty"
 frc_fourth_desc:0 "The Carolingian dynasty is the most powerful noble house of Europe. At its peak, the thrones of five separate kingdoms belonged to the members of our dynasty. We shall restore the glory of our house and perhaps even start a new golden century!"

 htm_third_desc:0 "Since the dissolution of Rus' during the Mongol invasion, the Principalities have lived under the Tatar Yoke, forced into submission and tributary status. If we wish to restore the glory of the Rus', we have to break the Tatar Yoke and free the steppe of the Mongol influence."

 htm_fifth:0 "Tame the Steppe"
 htm_fifth_desc:0 "For years, our people have lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle, reminiscent of our Mongol enemies. As the lands of Rus' are returning under our rightful control, and the eastern steppes are being freed from the grasp of the hordes, we must consolidate our rule over this region and settle it with our own people."
 htm_sixth:0 "Starshyna Council"

 htm_seventh_desc:0 "The steppe is a peculiar and treacherous place to live and when it comes to dying, the variety of choices is endless when you are horseless. When you enter the endless sea of grass, your horse stops being an animal or piece of property, and truly becomes a part of you. Just as your body cannot survive without a heart or a liver, in the steppes it certainly won't survive without a horse."

 adu_third:0 "Legacy of Balansiyah"
 adu_third_desc:0 "The Iberian Crusade of 1443 was a grim reminder of Christian brutality and savagery. We must not forget our brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives on the battlefields of Al-Andalus, protecting their homeland from our arch enemy. May Allah bring peace upon them."

 #Sweden
 swe_third:0 "The Holy Mission"
 swe_third_desc:0 "When the first Swedish kings converted to the Christian faith, they promised His Holiness the Pope that all of the north shall be converted to one true faith by word or by sword. This pledge gave Sweden extraordinary status within the Catholic world and made our ties with the Papal States extraordinary as well."
 swe_seventh:0 "Gud Vill Det"
 swe_seventh_desc:0 "The presence of Pagan faiths will not be tolerated. They must be removed from Scandinavia at once, and our holy crusade will make sure of that."
 #Naples
 nap_first:0 "The Byzantine Connection"
 nap_first_desc:0 "Long before our lands were conquered by the Sicilians, we were under the control of the Byzantine Empire. Our first duke, Basil, nonetheless saw our most illustrious city become a largely nominal part of the empire for generations to come. With our newfound independence, we shall attempt to re-establish those links to ward off encroaching neighbours."
 nap_second:0 "University of Naples"
 nap_second_desc:0 "Although it was established under the Saracen yoke, the knowledge and understanding gained within the University of Naples’ hallowed halls are too vital for the state to simply throw away. With utmost caution, considering some heretically secular writings found within, our scholars shall thoroughly seek greater understanding of this world God has bestowed upon us."
 nap_third:0 "Coinage of the Latins"
 nap_third_desc:0 "We are still but a small nation on the world stage. If we are to gain allies, we must look to the north and, by extension, utilise their coinage instead of the Byzantine or Saracen currency. Should we do this, we can restructure our tax system into a much less archaic state."
 nap_fourth:0 "The Church of San Giovanni"
 nap_fourth_desc:0 "A beautiful Romanesque piece of architecture, the Church of San Giovanni shows not only our dedication to the Lord above, but also to our own heritage. With Greek, Norman, and even a few examples of Arabic artwork found within, Naples has never seen a more interesting blend of styles."
 nap_fifth:0 "Avengers of the Coalition"
 nap_fifth_desc:0 "The previous century saw a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Saracens, after the disunited Italian Coalition failed to stop them from encroaching upon the lands of Christians. This must never happen again!  The invaders must be driven from our lands, and we shall do what the coalition failed to accomplish so long ago!"
 nap_sixth:0 "Alliance with the Southern Cities"
 nap_sixth_desc:0 "Our rulers have long since understood the fine art of balancing rivalling court factions within the grand city of Naples itself. Messina, Taranto, Palermo, and the rest of the southern cities shall be far easier to manage when we integrate them into our realm."
 nap_seventh:0 "Castel Nuovo"
 nap_seventh_desc:0 "The Castel Nuovo, built by the Normans as a defensive line within Naples but greatly expanded by the Saracens, is undoubtedly a marvellous feat of architecture. From its Triumphal Arch, to the Hall of the Barons and great Tower of the Beverello, power is exuded from her mighty walls. This is a castle built to last the ages!"

 kus_first:0 "Kushan Dinara"
 kus_first_desc:0 "The Kushan Empire's dinara is prized and intensely sought after by foreign antiquarians for its frequent depictions of deities and kings, but it holds a far greater materialistic value. The imperial coinage contains high quantities of gold and silver, far more than most other nations, and it is for this reason that the dinara is the envy of the world."
 kus_second:0 "Yuezhi Legacy"
 kus_second_desc:0 "The Yuezhi were fearsome and proud nomadic people, whose influence stretched across a large swathe of Asia. Alas, our ancestors would eventually be scattered by the Gupta Empire, and were driven into the Tarim Basin. With the rebirth of the Kushan Empire, however, we shall remind the world of who we once were, and who they will prostrate before."
 kus_third:0 "Re-establish the Kshatrapas"
 kus_third_desc:0 "Our great Kushan Empire is too vast in its land and diverse in its peoples for an efficient centralised bureaucracy. Looking back to the First Kushan Empire, it is clear that we must grant a degree of self-governance to the locals, and what better way is there to go about this than by appointing a loyal noble to govern their own people - in our name."
 kus_fourth:0 "Dominance of the Silk Road"
 kus_fourth_desc:0 "Euro-Asiatic Trade is heavily centred on the Silk Road, which spans the length of Anatolia to China. Much to our good fortune, all routes lead through Kushan territory, meaning that merchants must pay tolls to travel both ways. Should we increase policing of these trade networks, and establish toll booths near oases and cities, we can dominate the flow of commerce between East and West!"

Should we increase policing of these trade networks, and establish toll booths near oases and cities, we can dominate the flow of commerce between East and West!"
 kus_fifth:0 "Syncretic Tolerance"
 kus_fifth_desc:0 "Much akin to the Kushan Empire of old, we find that securing the loyalty of our countless subjects can be attained readily through the state religion. By granting the various deities of our subjects an important status within the Imperial Cult, even if the official religion of the empire may differ from theirs, we will nonetheless pave the way to a more expedient integration process."
 kus_sixth:0 "Kushan Arts"
 kus_sixth_desc:0 "The old Kushan school of art was greatly influenced by pre-existing Greco-Bactrian, Iranic, and Indian schools, culminating in one of the most striking styles of its time. Alas, this revered style was lost to our disillusioned people until recently. Soon, Neo-Kushan relief sculptures shall be adorning the pediments of temples and the sprawling halls of extravagant palaces! Our art will surpass anything in the legendary cities of Constantinople and Alexandria, a thousand times over!"
 kus_seventh:0 "Devaputra Shaonanoshao"
 kus_seventh_desc:0 "Meaning 'Son of God, King of Kings' in the old Kushan tongue, these revered titles had been stolen from our forefathers by Samudragupta of the Gupta Empire, though in time even his line would be deprived of such honours. Our return to greatness necessitates the recognition of our sovereigns as the Devaputra Shaonanoshao, but they must prove themselves worthy of such splendour, lest we be stripped of our pride yet again..."

 asg_second:0 "Reform the Hunting Parties"
 asg_second_desc:0 "Our tribal military mostly consists of armed hunting parties with poor training and outdated equipment. While still effective against the other Jurchen tribes, our forces are no match for Mongol or Chinese troops. The hunting parties shall receive proper training and be reformed into permanent civil-military units called banners."

 asg_fifth:0 "Employ the Chinese and Mongol Frontier Generals"
 asg_fifth_desc:0 "The Chinese and Mongol military units stationed at the borders of the Empire have long mingled with the Jurchen people, adopting Manchu names and tribal customs. By offering them high ranks in our army, we would not only gain military skills and technical knowledge, but also make it easier for us to adopt institutional models of their more advanced societies."
 asg_sixth:0 "Steppe Leaders"
 asg_sixth_desc:0 "Even though our country's ultimate goal is to restore the Imperial dynasty which would rule the Middle Kingdom, we must not forget the legacy of our ancestors. By preserving our ancient traditions of the hunt, we ensure that our armies are always led by men who understand the use of the horse in combat."
 asg_seventh:0 "Claim the Mandate of Heaven"

Of course, our realm is unified not just in politics, but also in faith. The Swedish crusade was a long one, filled with bloodshed and heartbreak, but we have finally brought the words of Christ to our brothers in arms, saving their souls from eternal damnation. Our union is blessed by God, and our realm protected by his grace."
 sca_second:0 "Baltic Arsenal"

 bnv_second:0 "Reclaim Langobardia Minor"
 bnv_second_desc:0 "Langobardia Minor was the name that, in early Middle Ages, was given to the Lombard dominion in central-southern Italy, corresponding to the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento. After the conquest of the Lombard kingdom by Charlemagne in 774 it remained under Lombard control, later completely falling under the control of Sicily. As an independent state and heir to the legacy of Lombard power in Southern Italy, we must reclaim the lands of our ancestors."
 bnv_third:0 "Beneventan Chant"
 bnv_third_desc:0 "Beneventan chant is a liturgical plainchant repertory of the Roman Catholic Church, used primarily in the orbit of the southern Italian ecclesiastical centres of Benevento and Monte Cassino distinct from Gregorian chant and related to Ambrosian chant. It was officially supplanted by the Gregorian chant of the Roman rite in the 11th century, although a few Beneventan chants of local interest remained in use."
 bnv_fourth:0 "Frankish Reconciliation"

 bnv_fifth:0 "Beneventan Script"
 bnv_fifth_desc:0 "The beneventan script was a medieval script which originated in the Duchy of Benevento in southern Italy. It was also called Langobarda, Longobarda, Longobardisca (signifying its origins in the territories ruled by the Lombards), or sometimes Gothica. The script could be reintroduced and widely taught again, significantly increasing the literacy of our people."
 bnv_sixth:0 "Restore the Rule of the Cross"
 bnv_sixth_desc:0 "Most of Southern Italy already belongs to our Duchy; however, centuries of Muslim rule had caused the conversion of the locals to Islam.

Now that the Byzantines have been crippled, our humble state is the only one with a hope of reclaiming the Exarchate of Italy for our people. This dream is what motivates our tireless countrymen - Roman rule in Italy once more!"
 api_second:0 "Tolerate the Latins"
 api_second_desc:0 "When we were subjects of the Byzantines, we took a more pragmatic approach to religion than our masters in Constantinople. A Christian is a Christian, be they Greek, Lombard, or Norman - and with Magna Graecia under the despotic boot of heathens it is clear we have bigger problems on our hands than petty theological squabbles."
 api_third:0 "Beat Back the Heathen"
 api_third_desc:0 "The Normans, as fearsome and proud as they were, ultimately failed to protect us from the Saracen onslaught. By the grace of Providence, we have been given a chance to succeed where they failed - and when our time comes, our brave soldiers will be ready."
 api_fourth:0 "Integrate the Norman Regiments"
 api_fourth_desc:0 "During Byzantine and even Arab rule Normans, particularly their knights, were highly sought after as mercenary contingents. Now that we are free, however, we have an opportunity to go a step further and offer these skilled men a permanent, lead role in our armies, in exchange for tolerating their heretical views and given small plots of land to call their own in Sicily. They will only boost our martial prowess!"
 api_fifth:0 "Promote Griko Dialect in Court"
 api_fifth_desc:0 "Our dialect was looked at back home with disdain, when we were subjects to the haughty knavel-gazers in Constantinople. Now that we have carved out a respectable position in the world, it is time our language and culture were promoted in our courts over Athenian Greek and Lombard - only then will others learn to respect us."
 api_sixth:0 "Host Byzantine Exiles"
 api_sixth_desc:0 "Some things never change. Power-hungry pretenders rise up in Constantinople, they are inevitably crushed, and they seek a place to live out the rest of their years in exile. These men are not fools - most of them anyway, and could serve as valuable advisors, noblemen, and diplomats - so long as they are made to understand how indebted to us they are once they arrive."
 api_seventh:0 "The Patriarch of Rome"
 api_seventh_desc:0 "Much like our Lombard and Norman countrymen, we too venerate the Patriarch of Rome, and are sick of being lorded over in theological matters by foreigners in Constantinople. By Bringing the Bishop of Rome under our influence, and promoting it as our head church while not outwardly questioning the supremacy of the Patriarch in Constantinople, we can gain more religious independence from our old homeland - and look legitimate in the eyes of our subjects."

 cap_third:0 "Sellswords of Saint Peter"

 cap_fourth:0 "Legacy of Robert Guiscard"
 cap_fourth_desc:0 "Yes, it is true that Capua's rulers are Normans by descent. That fact cannot and will not be denied, for the Duchy's sovereigns are proud descendants of Robert Guiscard!

 cap_fifth:0 "Bread and Circuses"
 cap_fifth_desc:0 "In the early 15th Century, Rufus III de Hauteville, Duke of Capua, began construction of a grand amphitheatre on the site of the ancient Roman Amphitheatre of Capua - among the largest and oldest in Italy. Completed by Rufus’ son, the “Mad Duke” Robert XI, it rose to infamy due to the reintroduction of bloodsports shortly thereafter. The “panem et circenses” policy of the Norman rulers has proven extraordinarily popular with the Capuan people to this day, helping to distract them from the looming threats to the north and south. Innumerable crowds flock to witness and bet on great mock-battles, performances, sporting competitions, and even parades on a near-weekly basis."
 cap_sixth:0 "Castello dei Principi Normanni"
 cap_sixth_desc:0 "The 11th Century Castello dei principi Normanni, or Castle of the Norman Princes, stands as a symbol of victory against overwhelming odds. During the Saracen onslaught of the 1350s, the overwhelmed Normans sought refuge in the castle, having fled from Naples not long prior. When all hope seemed lost, Hubert de Hauteville, the last king of Trinacria, sallied out with his knights under the shroud of darkness. In a daring yet unanticipated night attack, the Norman cavalry forced the Sicilians into full retreat. Hubert’s pyrrhic victory preserved Capua’s independence, and won the Hauteville line recognition as its hereditary Dukes."

This road was used by traders to transport and sell amber, stretching as far into the Mediterranean and Egypt.

For us, control of the Baltic sea is even more important since most of our economy is subject to the flow of the Baltic trade. Thankfully we have gained control of a significant portion of the Baltic coastline, giving us greater control over which ships sail the seas. No longer will we be manipulated by those wealthier than us and we will make sure that Baltic profits go to the Baltic people."

The Baltic Kingdom works more like a union of people where everyone is sufficiently represented in regional and national matters. This harmony is credited to the way our rulers regularly work with and listen to the various tribes that inhabit the Baltics, making sure that they all have the right amount of autonomy while still contributing to the Kingdom. This greater unity between our subjects will keep the nation together in times of crisis and prevent the infighting that is prevalent in other European kingdoms."

Threatened by the Slavs, almost exterminated by the Christians, and isolated from the affairs of Europe, there has been no justice for the victims and no punishment for those who are guilty. The people of the Baltic can no longer stand by and just watch as our suffering is ignored and our traditions are tarnished by heathens. Christians speak of forgetting the sins of the past and forgiving, but we in the Baltics live by a very different motto. Those who stand on the sidelines and do nothing will be swept away and forgotten by history. Everyone who has ever wronged us will suffer as we have suffered, Europe will burn in a crusade of their own, and the name Pagan will spread terror deep into the hearts of every so-called 'good Christian'."

 eng_first_desc:0 "With the destruction and bloodshed caused by the nordic Vikings still fresh in the consciousness of our people, it has become painfully obvious that to protect ourselves from foreign invaders we must first prevent them from dominating us on our waters. Our ships will act as a wall that guards our coasts and sink any foolish army that wishes to plunder our lands."
 eng_second:0 "Witenagemot"
 eng_second_desc:0 "While our ruler's word is the law, their word is sometimes not just their own. For centuries kings of England have been advised by the Witenagemot that is composed of important noblemen in our realm. This important institution has greatly benefited us by making sure that our ruler is properly aware of the current state of his/her Kingdom and more importantly how to suitably act in most courts in Europe."
 eng_third:0 "Royal Navy"
 eng_third_desc:0 "As our history has shown, a large navy can be equally as strong as a large army. Ever since we started to expel the Vikings from our lands our navy has grown significantly to prevent another invasion. Now the time has come for us to use our navy beyond the British Isles and like our old enemies use our navy to subjugate weaker kingdoms. Our Royal navy shall sink any fleet that dares to challenge our naval superiority."
 eng_fourth:0 "Burhs"
 eng_fourth_desc:0 "The Burhs are old fortifications that were constructed to defend against the Viking invasions centuries ago. Even though most of the Vikings have been expelled from the British isles, the Burhs are still being maintained and renovated to keep up with modern siege tactics. These fortifications will make sure that if an army ever sets foot on our island, they will be swiftly pushed back into the sea."
 eng_fifth:0 "Fyrd"
 eng_fifth_desc:0 "A fyrd is an army that is mobilised from freemen to defend their land against an invading enemy. Like most of our other defences, this system was designed as a reaction to the first Viking invasions. During our many wars with the Vikings our generals made a very useful observation regarding the success of the Fyrds, men fight harder if they are fighting for their own home."
 eng_sixth:0 "Unite the British Isles"
 eng_sixth_desc:0 "Except for the kingdom of Scotland, there is no strong power in the British Isles able to withstand invasions from overseas invaders. This is likely the reason the Vikings were able to subjugate much of the Isles on so many occasions. The final step in securing our homeland from foreign invasions is by eliminating those weak kingdoms that could be exploited by a stronger power. The British Isles are only fit to be ruled by one kingdom, namely ours."

 vlt_first_desc:0 "The Wendish people is not a singular culture, but more a name given to us and other tribes by the Germans that border us. The ancestors of Velvet originate from tribes of Slavs called the Lechtics although this technicality does not concern the German's since they see all Slavs as potential enemies. Disregarding the origin of the term Wends, the idea of a united people against the encroaching Germans has become popular in recent years and many support the idea of uniting the fractured tribes of Slavs that settled these areas for so many centuries ago. Most of these tribes now live in other Slavic kingdoms that don't share our vision of unity, but some may be under the cruel boot of foreign oppressors. Nevertheless, vast lands need to be conquered by us to unite our people under one realm."
 vlt_second:0 "Repel the Germans"
 vlt_second_desc:0 "Ever since the Slavic migration caused by the Huns, there have been countless conflicts between the Germanic and Slavic peoples. Our realm is at the edge of the Germanic world, meaning that if the Germans seek to expand their settlements, we will be one of their first targets. We cannot allow our people to be pushed around and removed from rightful Slavic lands that have been ours for centuries. Our soldiers are fighting for their own homes and families and will fight with the strength of ten men to repel any attacker from our lands."

Now the worship of Svetovid is at the centre of our theocracy and it's our duty as true worshipers to spread his name as far as possible."
 vlt_fourth:0 "Slavic Temper"
 vlt_fourth_desc:0 "Due to our many conflicts with the Germanic peoples, us Slavs are seen as barbaric and uncivilised. This is untrue of course, but we would be lying if we didn't portray our German enemies with the same savagery. However, as the delicate balance of power is constantly shifting in Europe, we can no longer remain diplomatically isolated except for our Slavic brothers. Our diplomats will disprove these foul prejudices and show that Veleti is a reasonable and civil Kingdom that can be trusted as an ally. With this tempering of relations, we will no longer be alone in our struggle."

 obd_second:0 "Intercept Hanseatic Shipping"
 obd_second_desc:0 "The Hanseatic league has for ages tried to undermine and challenge our rule over Wendia with the aid of their large trade network that spans the Baltic sea. However, their greatest strength can also be turned into a weakness. By blockading the ports of the Hanseatic cities we will cut them off from their German brothers, making them a vulnerable target for our armies to finish the fight."
 obd_third:0 "Dominate the Baltics"
 obd_third_desc:0 "The Baltic is the centre of some of the most lucrative trade in Northern Europe, connecting the Wendish kingdoms to the Scandinavian kingdoms, the Finnic chiefdoms, and the Novgorod Merchant republic.

Our admirals know the sea like the back of their hand and our smaller galley sail in circles around larger ships, tearing them and their crew apart with ruthless ferocity."
 obd_fifth:0 "Preserve the Polabian Language"
 obd_fifth_desc:0 "The Polabian language is the language used by all the Wendish tribes and can be summarised as a Slavic language with a strong German influence. Nevertheless, the approaching presence of the German kingdoms has led to the status of the language being threatened and replaced by German. Thanks to the recent efforts of our scholars to promote Plobian literature and create a universal Polabian language, Polabian has started to resurface among both common peasants and intellectuals. With our help, the Polabian language and its unique history will be preserved for future generations."

 abs_third_desc:0 "The Abbasid Caliphs are descended from Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad, thus meaning that we have a rightful claim to the Caliphate.

 abs_fourth:0 "Patrons of Art and Science"
 abs_fourth_desc:0 "Abbasid rule in Baghdad was known for its patronage of the arts and sciences, having been regarded as a golden age for Islam by many. With our restoration in Cairo, many scholars, philosophers, and more have come to seek our patronage like others did long ago. Soon we shall see the flourishing of a second golden age."
 abs_fifth:0 "Bureau of Confiscation"
 abs_fifth_desc:0 "By looking back to some of the old Persian traditions, we must revive the “Bureau of Confiscation” as a legitimate section of the Abbasid government. This bureau shall serve to punish and deter corruption within the state apparatus, seizing assets from the lowest city official to the Grand Vizier himself, if they are found to have done wrong by the Caliph."
 abs_sixth:0 "Islamic Literature"

Just like Kamuy-huci, we guard the hearth that is our tradition, and we shall never let it burn out."

With our reclamation of Tibet and the re-establishment of this organisation to aid us in control over this vast new territory, we once more find ourselves in an authoritative position on all matters regarding Buddhist traditions. This is a privilege we take pride in, and one that we shall use to better the practice of every monastery, monk, and practitioner in our realm."

 XUN_third_desc:0 "The old administration was led by two distinct individuals, the Sakya Lama and the Dpon-Chen. While the Lama spent time either leading religious ceremonies or living in Khanbaliq, the Dpon-Chen would rule the country as a civilian leader. While the great administrator was traditionally chosen by the Yuan Emperor, our current Khan has decided to circumvent this and choose for himself, discussing with the Lama on who best to officiate and watch over the realm.

His men rode with speed and fury, cutting down any resistance the monasteries put up against them, reaching Sakya to aid them in defence against the Tsang invaders. Despite the collapse of Sakya authority over Tibet in the aftermath of this rebellion, Agwang’s campaign is remembered as the last charge of the Mongols in Tibet.

These controlled waters allow for rapid transit of goods across our coasts without the fear of pirates and hostile fleets interrupting them, acting as extensions of the sea but under our complete control. As a result, merchants are significantly safer in our lands than elsewhere in the Baltic, giving them more incentive to trade with us."

The hatred aimed at the Borjigin clan was so strong indeed that our destruction of their Yuan Dynasty has been met not with denouncement and anger, but with acceptance.

Many outsiders claim that this process is tyrannical, and question why the Daimyo do not simply rise against the weakened Shogun.

When the revolt was finally subdued and its leaders executed, the Wenhu had an idea. Instead of imprisoning or killing those who resisted them, they instead conscripted them into the army, granting them certain privileges to prevent them from uprising again. This led to a well-trained fighting force that was knowledgeable about the area and was ready to support the Wenhu in any way they knew how."

 tgu_second:0 "Courting of the Black Headed Tanguts"
 tgu_second_desc:0 "Our patronage of the priestly caste to support us and bless our leaders with their sage advice has paid off wonderfully.

We cannot let these ties go to waste, as the political eminence they bring will ensure our continued importance in steppe politics."
 tro_fourth:0 "Forest People"

 tro_fifth:0 "Religious Tolerance"
 tro_fifth_desc:0 "Over the centuries many faiths have come and gone from the lands that surround us from Islamic merchants to Christian Scholars, and even Buddhist monks.

 tro_sixth:0 "Foreign Expeditions"

 odl_fifth:0 "Freedom From Tribute"
 odl_fifth_desc:0 "The Temugids reigned over Manchuria with an iron fist to provide tribute for their overlords in Yuan for many years. Over this period, however, they gradually began to crumble and recede until we no longer had to pay them any heed. The relief brought by the loss of tribute demands has allowed us to expand merchandise tactics to the point where we can become a new hub for trade in the Orient."
 odl_sixth:0 "Soldiers Eat First"
 odl_sixth_desc:0 "In the late 14th century a series of particularly harsh winters led to a devastating wave of famine. To remedy this, a court advisor called Sholontu "the Starved" proposed a controversial system whereby most of the food produced would be confiscated and sent first to the soldiers, thereby remedying the issue of starvation in the army."
 odl_seventh:0 "Reject Culture Shift"
 odl_seventh_desc:0 "Even during the era of the Great Jin, it was obvious that we were beginning to be influenced by Chinese culture.

 tmg_second:0 "Kublai's Folly"
 tmg_second_desc:0 "Kublai Khan's persistence in treading the path of Sinification threatened the Mongol way of life, and so Prince Nayan, the most renowned sovereign of our realm, took it upon himself to raise the banner of rebellion. We must remind the world that it was we who felled the Great Khan."
 tmg_third:0 "Oriental Christianity"

 hnn_first_desc:0 "The Eight Views are a historical set of the most beautiful landscapes in the Xiaoxiang region. Various prominent artists from the Song era have created paintings on this theme after being exiled to Xiaoxiang, showing their discontent and isolation through beautiful art. To this day, skilled painters all across China travel to Xiaoxiang to refine their art, giving us a wide network of people that may be invited to our court."
 hnn_second:0 "The Last of the Red Turbans"
 hnn_second_desc:0 "The Han Dynasty stands alone in China as the last remnant of the Red Turban Rebellions. Although weakened by inter-Chinese warfare in the past years, our state is one of the most powerful in the south: the dream of fully evicting the barbarians from China remains fully possible still. This idea of liberation strengthens our soldiers' morale and allows them to keep fighting even when defeat seems certain."
 hnn_third:0 "Yichang Depots"
 hnn_third_desc:0 "Since ancient times the city of Yichang has served as a supply hub for several empires. The city's positioning on the Yangtze makes transport of weapons and ammunition to the front line extremely easy, ensuring that fresh soldiers and weapons can be brought to our armies with incredible speed."

 hnn_fifth:0 "Diplomatic Pragmatism"
 hnn_fifth_desc:0 "We have often been required to ally with surrounding Chinese states to survive, even if they are our direct rivals in securing hegemony over China. First allying with the Zhou to fight the Song, to becoming fierce rivals just to ally again in face of Yuan invasion, our nation is in a constant flux of making and breaking alliances. This has led our diplomats to become very good at convincing other states that we are trustworthy, regardless of previous conflicts."
 hnn_sixth:0 "Enemies On All Sides"
 hnn_sixth_desc:0 "We have fought hard against almost every state in China, winning and losing battles in a state of near constant war for a century. The fighting has drained our troops, but has led to great advances in creating fortifications able to defend against modern gunpowder weaponry: few states can match the grandeur of our fortresses."
 hnn_seventh:0 "Civilise the Interior"
 hnn_seventh_desc:0 "Much of our nation consists of rolling hills or mountains, sparsely inhabited and pagan in worship. These lands must be populated by learned men, where they will have two roles to play: labourers to civilise the land, and sages to civilise the barbarians."

 min_idea_second_desc:0 "Born in 1330, Chen Youding was a prolific commander in the Yuan general army. Serving alongside the legendary conqueror Toghon Khan, they quelled and subdued the Ispah Rebellion within Xinghua. Furthermore, he joined the rebellion against the Yuan, and pushed them back beyond the Yellow River. While other states continued to squabble and bicker and even wage war on one another, he gathered local support and shored up defensives. Min would become a powerhouse both in trade and in military might."
 min_idea_third:0 "Legacy of the Ispah Rebellion."
 min_idea_third_desc:0 "In 1357, a mass revolt by the Persian trading class within the city of Quanzhou spread out fast and quickly, gaining support from mercenaries and merchant families on their march to Fujian. However, Chen Youding put down this revolt, crushing them effortlessly. This caused a mass exodus and execution of the various religious minorities in the region, which eventually resettled during the following decades. Our kingdom is known for housing religions ranging from Zoroastrianism, Christianity, local hybrid faiths, and many others. To keep the peace is something our rulers identified as one of the key failures of the previous Yuan administration that led to the rebellion. As such, they have created a division within the government dedicated to calming this religious tension before it flares up into further rebellions."
 min_idea_fourth:0 "International Relations"
 min_idea_fourth_desc:0 "Our presence is known across Asia. In Vietnam, we have officials from our province serving as officials and leaders.

 min_idea_fifth:0 "Reintegration of the Semu Families"
 min_idea_fifth_desc:0 "The Semu people from Arabia to Persia have always held dominance in our city. However, after the Ispah Rebellion, our people have formulated a strong distaste for foreigners and have consistently viewed them as troublemakers. We must make peace with them, keeping them loyal to our government, while also making sure they are not in a position to potentially attack us again."
 min_idea_sixth:0 "Coastal Defences"
 min_idea_sixth_desc:0 "Our coastline has been the site of raids from Malay and Taiwanese pirates, who would come in with their junks and cause havoc while they ransacked our wealth. We must create a large navy, capable of not only fighting back against these navies, but also so omnipresent that they wouldn’t even dare attempt a raid!"
 min_idea_seventh:0 "Ispah Militias"
 min_idea_seventh_desc:0 "The Persians during the rebellion used militias and mercenaries to threaten the security of the realm. In our time during the Red Turban Rebellion, we saw the havoc a well-organised militia can create on even the strongest army, especially on their home turf. We shall create a series of militias, funded by local guardsmen and mercenaries, that can be used for hit and run tactics in the case of a long and protracted foreign invasion. If Min shall fall, it shall go down kicking and screaming!"

 UWA_second:0 "Iyo Resistance"
 UWA_second_desc:0 "In the Year 1418, our realm was invaded by the clan of Hata, who sought to expand their reach across Shikoku. Despite the city of Yuzuki falling into enemy hands, our Daimyo Katsumoto Uwa led a brutal guerilla campaign in the province, taking full advantage of the terrain before finally liberating the city and removing the Hata as a threat to our legitimacy."
 UWA_third:0 "Shingon Adherence"
 UWA_third_desc:0 "Our royal lineage is not originally from the lands of Japan; they instead originate from the territories of inner Mongolia. However, upon arriving, our leaders quickly took up scholarship and learning in the Shingon school of Buddhism, a native teaching to the lands. This not only secured our position amongst the Sangha, but also with the general populace, as fellow practitioners of the faith."

These people often bring new and innovative ideas into our kingdom, and as such we grant them rights and protections so they do not fall victim to persecution."
 UWA_seventh:0 "Subjugation of the Peasants"
 UWA_seventh_desc:0 "The period directly following the rise of the Toyouji Shogunate saw a slew of rebellions in our territory.

From the initial invasions to their many excursions to the mainland to assist the Yuan, they are known for being some of the best leaders to take a crack at a stalling assault on a fort; they only will need a few siege engines and some hardy soldiers and they will breach any wall."

 HTA_sixth_desc:0 "The taxation system that the old Japanese Daimyo used on these lands was weak and crumbling in comparison to ours. We can effectively gain the revenue our state needs to maintain our steady growth and expansion across the Japanese isles, and it's thanks to the wise guidance of the Hata clan that the system is able to operate as smoothly as it does."
 HTA_seventh:0 "Hata Arquebusiers"

 KWH_third:0 "Subjugation of the Satsuma"
 KWH_third_desc:0 "Prior to the Mongol Invasion, the Satsuma clan resided over the territory we now control. Instead of eradicating them, we placed them as subservient to our own, forcing political marriages and adoption on their heirs to further integrate the two families. Thanks to this, our two families remain interlocked, and the political influence and military ability that the Satsuma had are now ours as well."

 KWH_fifth:0 "Raids on the Morokata"
 KWH_fifth_desc:0 "Our generals have often led raiding parties out into the neighbouring Daimyo, especially the Morokata. Like lightning, we strike in darkness to attack and pillage neighbouring towns and cities, leaving devastation in our wake. This has led our Daimyo to develop a fast and quick form of warfare that relies on brutal shock tactics to win engagements quickly and efficiently."
 KWH_sixth:0 "Tsurumaru Castle"
 KWH_sixth_desc:0 "In the Year 1424, Lord Hisanaga Kuwahara was the first Prince to see the great Tsurumaru Castle finished. This grand castle was a masterclass in construction and design, so much so that other daimyo rushed to the Toyouji, warning them that this was a sign that the Kuwahara were planning to build up power and overthrow them. However, thanks to Hisanaga’s diplomats and court relatives, the Toyouji were assured that this was merely a castle for protection against bandits and raiders. The Shogun even sent funds to help the Toyouji, to show their support for stabilising and centralising the realm. Thus, the elegant castle remained beautiful and effective."

She joined in the Mongol Invasions, and due to her excellence on the battlefield, claimed the territory of Bungo for herself, and established a mighty dynasty in the isles. As such, many women of the court will often seek to replicate her success, signing up to be generals and leaders themselves."

Conscription of the peasants as well as the samurai might bolster our ranks, but it could simply lead to our military becoming a paper tiger.

 NKT_sixth:0 "Laws of Mochimasu"
 NKT_sixth_desc:0 "Having only been in power for a decade or so, Mochimasu Nakata has already crafted many legislation changes within his realm. Primarily, he pushed to enforce the social hierarchy commonplace throughout Japan, separating people into different social strata as to better rule over them. While merchants and some local peasant lords have complained, this brought the nobility and the samurai to his side, furthering his family’s control over the region."

These monks began a legacy of teaching Tantric Buddhism in the court, and while their religious advice sometimes drove wedges between the mostly Pure Land Buddhist teachings of the Nakata, their advice on how to deal with peasants and fortifications is second to none and has aided the Nakata clan in their fight for dominance for many generations."

 roc_second_desc:0 "The Art of War, amongst many other Chinese great works of military tactics, such as the famous Romance of the Three Kingdoms, are renowned for their military genius. Yet after the chaotic decades following the Red Turban Rebellion the battle tactics taught in these books have been forgotten. We must study such great works to boost our own military tactics. A Renaissance of the East! As such we can call it."

These veteran trackers, hunters, and footmen have known the often brutal reality of life in the Taklamakan Desert since their youth, which gives them an overwhelming advantage when the need arises to traverse it.

When the Ayyubids grew in strength, our emperors converted to Sunni Islam. When the Persians allied with the court, they would convert to Mazdayasna. If they came from the Beyliks in the west, they would adhere to the Byzantine Church. However, after the loss of the east, Hashim the Pious maintained our sovereignty and converted to Islam in 1304 at the behest of a Sufi mystic. Since then, our state has been extremely dutiful in our mission to Allah, none more so than the Conquer Arslan, who, after his siege and sack of Trebizond, converted the city to the true faith with great haste. Under his guidance, we follow the words of the Prophet and continue our glorious expansion under the protection and grace of God."
 sel_second:0 "Reconquest of the Empire"
 sel_second_desc:0 "In the 13th Century, our great empire fell victim to the expansion of the Mongol Empire. The forces of Hulegu swept through Persia and emerged from the Zagros with a might and fury even our strongest forces could not match. We were pushed back into Anatolia and saved thanks to the assistance of the Ayyubid and their mighty cavalry. The Beyliks to the west and east alike broke from our command, claiming the territory for their own like vultures squabbling over a rotting carcass. But now, we shall reclaim what was lost to us. With the Ilkhans broken and our forces growing, the House of Seljuk shall once more be a name feared by all!"
 sel_third:0 "Expansion of Khans and Caravanserai"
 sel_third_desc:0 "Our territory lies at a key crossroads in the vast silk road trade network. Through us, goods flow from Asia into the ports of Italy, Andalus, and Egypt; silk, spices, fabrics, weapons, even stories and legends pass through our great Empire. The Caravanserai we place across our territory act as resting spots for merchants in rural areas, with a Khan acting as its counterpart in major cities and towns. As our empire continues to grow, we must ensure that merchants are to be respected and cared for; that they can travel and sell their wares without fear of both banditry and exhaustion."
 sel_fifth:0 "The Four-Iwan Mosques"
 sel_fifth_desc:0 "Our empire is home to a fusion of both Persian and Arabic culture, especially after the conversion to Islam in the 14th Century. This can be seen no clearer than in the design of our great mosques and palaces. A four-iwan mosque is a masterwork of both design and utility, with its large pishtaq decorated with geometric symbols and drawings along with a domed ceiling, as well as large halls for lecture and debate about the nature of the world that Allah has granted us. These holy buildings were often attached to madrassas and caravanserai, making them hubs for learning and studying. This architectural style is renowned worldwide, with great scholars and travellers alike praising their beauty."
 sel_fourth:0 "Patronage of the Sufis"
 sel_fourth_desc:0 "Our conversion to Islam was mostly initiated by many of the Sufi mystics that inhabited our realm prior to our conquest. The more personal and individual nature of the practice has been appealing to many of our scholars and nobles, and as such when Hashim converted to the faith and adopted the customs of Sunni Islam, the Sufi mystics were instrumental in the spreading of the faith across the diverse realm. They established lodges and communities in major urban centres, from Erzurum to Iconio, furthering our understanding of God and the soul."

The Beyliks that joined the Byzantine Church had done so to supplant our own power, and those that follow the Zoroastrian faith still look to Persia as an ally against us. We must increase our missionary activity if we are to maintain peace within our realm, to prevent the splintering of our empire due to false gods and heathen practices."

After this, instead of bowing to the Seljuks, Akgun the Great founded our own state on the banks of the Black Sea. Now, hundreds flock to our banners; not only does the state grant great rewards to those that fall in the line of duty, but the glory and honour it brings to serve is worth more than any prize or treasure that this Earth can give."

 zng_third:0 "Law of Konstantin"
 zng_third_desc:0 "When Konstantin was elected by the governing council to lead the Zangid republic, he did so with the support of Sunni merchants who funded his campaign and bribed opponents to drop out of the race. Konstantin knew that tensions between the Orthodox Christian populace and the Sunni traders that would often visit his land were getting worse, and so, he enacted special protections and guarantees for the Muslims in the Zangid realm. Instead of persecuting them, they would be protected and safeguarded by the state in civil and judicial matters, which eventually spread to not just Muslims, but Zoroastrians and Greeks and various other faiths and cultures. While Konstantin liked to pretend this came from his own humanist desires, in reality it was simply good business. Establishing protections for merchants of foreign heritages drew more merchants into Zangid, increasing the wealth and prosperity of the realm."
 zng_fourth:0 "The Zangid Republic"
 zng_fourth_desc:0 "The Zangid Republic was founded in the 13th Century by a powerful merchant guild. The internal squabbling of the various tribal leaders led to destruction and chaos around the city of Ankara, and in that time of upheaval, the merchant guilds took control of the apparatus of State, as they were the only ones with the wealth to control the military. Initially, the guilds were filled with different families and tribes, but the Zangid family took control over time. They began appointing new electors and leaders that were loyal to the Zangids and the Zangids alone, effectively monopolising the elections of presidents, creating an oligarchy run by this family."

This is where we shall find our niche; by dominating important centres of trade and expanding their infrastructure, we can create a new system by which trade shall pass from the east to the west untouched and intact, making us the dominant merchants of this new era."

We must re-establish our connections with eastern trade, and each province of our empire must have lodgings and services for these merchants."

 rumz_first_desc:0 "When the Ilkhanate was established over our homeland in the heart of Armenia, we submitted to their might and became loyal subjects. We gained from them new and innovative sieging techniques, involving canon fire and the encircling of cities to drive in refugees and starving masses. We integrated this alongside our military tradition, creating a hybrid Mongol-Turkic school of thought that is sure to terrify and subdue all who would oppose us."
 rumz_second:0 "Reconstruction of the Cities"
 rumz_second_desc:0 "The cities of Anatolia are our lifeblood, providing much of the wealth and power that drives our empire forward. However, there are problems with relying on these cities; they hold far too much power, and many of the beys and lords that hold sway there are only tenuously loyal. If we were to instead construct new cities, and staff them with loyal subjects and vassals, we could create a network of loyal and worthy subjects that we could entrust parts of our realm towards."

Our conquest was swift and absolute, as will be our reclamation of both the lands of the Seljuk Empire and the territory of Iran."

After we have returned to him the sacred objects, the Priests would proclaim that there were few errors in the ritual and that the war would be a success. We have the duty and obligation to drive away from the forces of darkness and destruction, not just on the cosmological scale, but also on the battlefield. We shall expand the Rûmi state, establishing an orderly realm wherever we shall go, and even if our realm is to suffer from a prolonged war, our people shall bear this strain. Just as Ahura Mazda needs our sacrifices and priests to aid them in the battle against evil, so too must we rely on our people to maintain hope in our conflicts, to fight back against invaders and enemies alike."

The Anushtenigids were emblematic of the mass conversions of the Turkic peoples living in the periphery of the Byzantine Empire. With the diplomatic and economic ties to the heart of Orthodox Christianity in Constantinople, many Turks converted in both an honest expression of faith as well as a way to gain power and influence in a post-Seljuk Anatolia.

Our fervour and dedication to the words of the Prophet and God is a defining feature of our state, as our support and patronage of mosques and numerous Sufi lodges can showcase. However, our empire is vast and large. In the homeland of the steppe, there are people who follow the old ways. They listen to the shamans for advice and guidance, and they perform rituals and traditions that are older than Seljuk himself.

These old tribes now mix with the new Kurd, Assyrian, and other native tribes of our new home to create a truly confusing amalgamation that greatly hinders our control. By focusing on uniting these disparate tribes into a more formal state, we can strengthen our current position."

 promote_silk_road_desc:0 "It is no secret that with the collapse of central Iranian authority, the once lucrative caravans that pass through the region have suffered. Let us look to the old Mongol traditions of land based trade and seek to protect and promote the Silk Road of Iran once again."
 restore_ilkhanate:0 "Restore the Ilkhanate"
 restore_ilkhanate_desc:0 "Until we reclaim the rest of Iran, we are but a shadow, hiding in the mountains like an animal. With our realm more unified than ever, and our enemies fractured, the time has come to sweep down from the mountains and retake what was lost to us."
 never_again:0 "Never Again"
 never_again_desc:0 "The history of Ilkhanate is one of many victories, but also great defeats. We have not forgotten what the Seljuks and Nizzards did to us. We must make sure that defeats such as these never happen again, our brave warriors will know this in their hearts. Let the Mongol banners flow through Iran once more!"
 ilduchi_leaders:0 "Ilduchi"
 ilduchi_leaders_desc:0 "Ilduchi or sword bearers, are a prestigious position reserved only for the most loyal and deadly warriors in the Ilkhanate. Sadly as our old empire decayed, the position became little more than a glorified retainer of the Khan. Let us re-establish this title as a battlefield position, and let these great warriors lead from the front once again!"
 persian_court:0 "A Persian Court"
 persian_court_desc:0 "Residing in a land as culturally rich as Persia has led much of our realm and court becoming Persianized. We now use many Persian titles, and employ many Persian governors and scholars in our administration. While some might see this as a weakness, We can use the long history of competent Persian administration to our advantage in running our great empire. "

 restored_ilkhanate: "Restored Ilkhanate"
 restored_ilkhanate_desc:0 "The Ilkhanate was originally established to secure Mongol rule over Persia in 1256. Many who have sought to rule Persia since have sought legitimacy by claiming descent from Genghis Khan, but our nation is a true revival of the first Ilkhanate. None can question our right to rule."
 tribes_of_iran:0 "Tribes of Iran"
 tribes_of_iran_desc:0 "Iran is filled with many formidable tribes, be they Turks, Mongols, Kurds, Pashtuns, or Lurs. While these tribes often squabble and fight amongst themselves, a strong central authority could rein them in and guarantee them certain rights and privileges. By doing this, we would be able to tap into a massive amount of manpower for our Khanate."
 persian_language_at_court:0 "Persian Language at Court"
 persian_language_at_court_desc:0 "Promoting a single language for use at court and within the state bureaucracy has clear advantages. Many of our elites have already adopted Persian as a second language, recognizing it as a prestigious and generally understood tongue throughout the world."
 yam_networks:0 "Yam Networks"
 yam_networks_desc:0 "Genghis Khan established a system of relay stations, supply networks, and intelligence gathering to be employed across the Mongol Empire to ease the burdens of governing an empire spanning thousands of miles across. We should restore the Yam so that our armies and envoys can travel efficiently through the realm."
 restore_the_tumen:0 "Restore the Tumen system"
 restore_the_tumen_desc:0 "The Tumen system of decimal organisation was created by Genghis Khan as a way to instil discipline and organisation into his victorious army. Sadly this system has fallen into decay as his successors failed to hold onto his empire. As the true successor to Genghis, it is only right that we should restore this system to its former glory, and create a new and improved Mongol Army."
 mongol_peace:0 "Mongol Peace"
 mongol_peace_desc:0 "Those who submit willingly to the Ilkhan can be sure that they will enjoy his protection. As word spreads of our benevolent and tolerant rule, resistance to our conquests will surely subside."

 legacy_of_hulagu_desc:0 "Hulagu Khan was not only the greatest Mongol conqueror since Genghis, but also one of the few of his successors to see the need for a reunified Mongol Empire. With our power restored, let us continue his Legacy and reunify the whole of the Mongols under one banner!"
