 COT_first:0 "Cros Chonga"
 COT_first_desc:0 "The Cross of Chong was commissioned by the great Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair in 1227, and it has been a symbol for our piety and devotion to the church ever since. Constructed in the traditional Insular style, with reference to Gothic and Norse artworks, it not only showcases our heritage of the various clans and peoples within our fair isle, but also with a piece of the True Cross in its center, our holy relic is famous across the Christian world."
 COT_second:0 "Subdue the Kingdoms"
 COT_second_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Treaty of Wexford in 1156, our position as the High King of Ireland has been put to the test. Our subjects have risen up time and time again in rebellion, either with pretenders or en masse as peasants. Be it in 1245 with the O’Brian raids, or in 1398 in the aftermath of the Peasant Uprisings, we have fought for our right to rule, and we shall do it again."
 COT_third:0 "The Three Connacht Castles"
 COT_third_desc:0 "In the year 1124, fortifications were placed in the settlements of Dun-Leodhar, Gailimh, and Cuil-maile. These fortifications aided us in the war with the Anglo-Saxons, giving us ground to defend ourselves. After the conflict, these fortifications were often rebuilt or strengthened by successors in order to shore up defenses against raiders. They stand strong to this day, defending our prized cities from all invaders."
 COT_fourth:0 "The Legacy of Tairrdelbach"
 COT_fourth_desc:0 "When Tairrdelbach rested the position of the High King from Muirchertach Ua Brian in the year 1115, he had gone forth and showcased his prowess as a military leader. Shattering the kingdom of Munster into three, and then defending the homeland from battles against the Anglo-Saxons, he was a true leader that many men feared. However, his failure to completely subdue these threats, both locally and abroad, left his descendants in a precarious position. They must be given an education and understanding in the art of warfare if we are to remove any threat that would come our way."
 COT_fifth:0 "The Tribes of Galway"
 COT_fifth_desc:0 "The Tribes of Galway came from all of the isle, and even from across the seas, from Iberia, Scandinavia, Frankia, and even England. They come bearing new and innovative ways to deal business, as well as help guide our lord in matters of economy and trade. With their help, we have expanded the city of Galway, and we should use their expertise to grow our other settlements as well."
 COT_sixth:0 "High King with Opposition"
 COT_sixth_desc:0 "Our Kingship has never truly been absolute; the title of High King has never been anything more than that, a title. The smaller Tuatha have been growing in power and influence, and those in Dublin and Cork now eye us with envy and greed. However, it is with both words and swords we will win them over. We must make peace with some of our enemies, granting them titles and claims in exchange for loyalty; that way we can assure loyalty even if we are vulnerable. And should they refuse the olive branch, we can always strike with the sword."
 COT_seventh:0 "An Irish Community"
 COT_seventh_desc:0 "Ireland has always been a hub for different peoples from Norseman to Saxons, traders and slavers, mercenaries and monks. We must not only listen to those from all walks of life to properly rule our fair island, but also learn from those foreign to us on new ideas and possibilities that we could use to create a new and better society for all."

 CRK_second:0 "Legacy of 1395"
 CRK_second_desc:0 "In the year 1395, the Anglo-Saxon marcher-lords of southern Ireland fought amongst each other as they tried to consolidate control over their domains. The Mac Oitir dynasty, hailing from the older Hiberno-Viking rulers of Cork, led a rebellion of peasants and displaced lords after the Anglo-Saxons attempted to extort us with their Black Rent. The fighting was brutal and bloody, with their forces being bled dry in the forests while we raided the towns. We managed to win the conflict thanks to our tenacity and the breaking of our enemy’s will. We shall continue to fight on, never to be conquered again!"
 CRK_third:0 "Lords of the City"
 CRK_third_desc:0 "The lords of the city are known across the isle as powerful and influential individuals. Their words hold sway on matters of trade, military, and diplomacy.

 CRK_fourth:0 "The Navy of Oitir"
 CRK_fourth_desc:0 "The Viking peoples, in particular, Ottir the Black, have always been an important part of our community – during the invasion by the Anglo-Saxons in 1110, the Hiberno-Viking navy sailed out to battle with the enemy Navy. While we lost that fight, we have since learned lessons about how to duel on the sea, and our rulers have saw fit to better fund and deploy our ships out on the open water."
 CRK_fifth:0 "Brave New World"
 CRK_fifth_desc:0 "Tales are oft told about a land to the far west, beyond the horizon. Our people seek this new world with vigor and hope, sailing on cargo ships, be it English or Iberian, or even Nord, they go towards a land of opportunity. We shall settle this new land ourselves and reap the riches of this new land for ourselves!"

 WTF_second:0 "Rivalry of the Port Cities"
 WTF_second_desc:0 "We have long since been rivals of the cities of Cork, Wexford, Dublin, and Limerick. In 1035, the King Ragnall escaped a trap set by the Dubliner King Sitric.

 WTF_third:0 "Land of Saint Declan"
 WTF_third_desc:0 "Saint Declan was one of the early saints in the 5th century who had Christianized the Munster region. His legacy remains in the region to this day, with the site of Declán of Ardmore standing proud. With ancient cathedrals and carvings of biblical tales, this site is a reminder of our heritage as Catholic peoples, and with our Hiberno-Viking rulers having converted some centuries ago, we remain in the light of the true path."
 WTF_fourth:0 "Peace with the Hinterlands"
 WTF_fourth_desc:0 "Like many of the Hiberno-Viking cities, our community was known for raiding and pillaging for resources and wealth. However, we have since made peace with the countryside, instead formalizing our relations, developing an agricultural and urban relationship with them. This has allowed a boom in our cities’ wealth and power, and we continue to find our treasury stacked to the brim with silver."
 WTF_fifth:0 "Modernized Gall Óglaigh"
 WTF_fifth_desc:0 "The Hiberno-Viking warrior bands, oft called the Gallowglass, roam around in support of various lords across the isles. With our wealth and access to foreign technologies, we shall help create a strong, modern mercenary force that is loyal to our kingdom and our kingdom alone."
 WTF_sixth:0 "Masters of the Sea"
 WTF_sixth_desc:0 "With access to Ireland’s vast forests and our own dockyards and harbors, we shall build a fleet unlike any has any seen in the isle’s history. This should be a suitable defense should enemies of both foreign and domestic come to challenge our power."
 WTF_seventh:0 "Aftermath of 1243"
 WTF_seventh_desc:0 "When we gained our independence from the English lord Adamnae, we were grateful towards the high king for giving support in the revolt. We have since learned that if we wish to expand our influence and our power on the isle, we must court the various kings and queens that rule here. Be it through marriage, gifts, or simple acts of kindness, we must make sure they would rather shake our hand than stab our throat. That way, in times of crisis, we shall have allies to fall back upon – however, should it be required, we can also use this friendship to ease them into a new position of vassalage underneath us."

 DUB_first_desc:0 "Dublin is the largest city in Ireland, and its position as a major trading hub has attracted minds from across the world. Byzantine scholars, Frankish nobles, Nord traders, and fellow Irish ecclesiarches. This melting pot of ideas and cultures grants us access to concepts and plans yet to be thought of, giving us an edge in technologies and institutions over our neighbors."
 DUB_sixth:0 "The Modern Longphort"
 DUB_sixth_desc:0 "On the south bank of the River Liffey sits the largest port in all of Ireland. Built off the old Viking trading routes, various goods would pass through this city, generating massive amounts of wealth for the lords of the settlement. In the aftermath of the 1395 Rebellions, trade has recently begun to favor Irish merchants over British ones, and we shall capitalize on this failure on their part!"
 DUB_third:0 "Lessons of the Raids"
 DUB_third_desc:0 "For nearly 200 Years, Ireland was rocked by a series of attacks by Viking Raiders. While their attempts to conquer the island failed, their rulers assimilated into the Irish culture and Christianized shortly after. However, that image of the Viking raider has not left the minds of our people, and as such, we have adopted their lightning-fast raiding stratagems into our navy, hoping to make up for our smaller naval size with quick and brutal warfare."
 DUB_fourth:0 "The Diocese of the Christ Church Cathedral"
 DUB_fourth_desc:0 "In the year 1030, long before the Anglo invasions, the King Sitric Silkenbeard built this Cathedral. He had built this new cathedral to gain the loyalty of the Church, and rulers since then have sought both the advice and the patronage of the archbishop that resides there. To this day, we still sponsor the priests that staff this sacred building, in exchange for their loyalty to our rule."
 DUB_fifth:0 "Re-establishment of the Peregrini"
 DUB_fifth_desc:0 "When the Viking lords raided the island, many of the old Irish scholars fled to various other Christian kingdoms. However, with our kingdom and its rulers now being fully brought into the fold of the Catholic Church, we should utilize their knowledge and skill that they had gained to our advantage."
 DUB_second:0 "The Dublin Market"
 DUB_second_desc:0 "Our marketplaces, once known for their slaves and wool, now see shipments of timber and copper flow out of our city.

 FNG_second_desc:0 "The house of Ímair is one of the great Norse-Gael dynasties that inhabited Dublin for centuries. Recently, with the invention of modern cannons and ballista weaponry, they had taken a liking to improving the alchemical make up of the gunpowder to make it even more explosive. Then, claiming that they needed to \"Prove themselves to their ancestors,\" they ran out into battle with an untested mix, and promptly had their heir lose all their limbs.

After this, Owain went on to act as the King’s right-hand man in subduing and quelling various rebellions across the kingdom.

Apparently, it was a gift from an English lord to the Welsh princes here, hoping they would use it in their efforts to win their war. When their crew had attempted to sail it all the way to Gwynedd, it was caught in a nasty storm, causing it to be damaged, and thus it needed to return to port for repairs. However, they didn’t realize that Owain's armies were marching on the city, and as such, brought it out of the frying pan and into the fire. It is said the Owain began to laugh when he found the ship, and immediately gathered some local sailors to help him sail it. He christened the ship the Golden Dragon, after his own personal standard. In the present, ships built across Prydain now fly the Golden Dragon Flag, the symbol of the Royal Navy."

However, thanks to our timely rise to power, the age of the Britons has returned to the isles! Our new state shall take a page out of the old Roman laws, that through servitude in the military, anyone can be considered a Briton. This will not only bolster our ranks, but also allow us to inspire a sense of loyalty across our new dominion."

 GDL_first:0 "The Goidelic Revolution"
 GDL_first_desc:0 "The Goidelic languages include Irish, Manx, Scottish Gaelic and the Norse Gaelic dialects. They share commonalities in both speech and society, as our religious and cultural traditions were born together and have merely drifted apart over time. In this new realm, all of these cultures have been unified under a singular banner through the Goidelic revolution. We shall watch with eager eyes to see how the Goidelic people shall innovate and dominate the coming future."
 GDL_second:0 "Legacy of the High King"
 GDL_second_desc:0 "Both the Scottish Gaels and the Irish had a name for their overlord - the High King. A king over all the other kings. Goidelia shall adopt the title for our rulers, to showcase both our heritage and our future. The High King shall reign over all of the Isles and beyond!"
 GDL_third:0 "Dreams of the New World"
 GDL_third_desc:0 "Far, far to the west, across the great sea, there's a place called the New World. It's warm and fertile. Where neither slavery nor the fires of war can reach. This is the dream carried in the hearts of all those who hope for a better future. They stare at the sea longingly, hoping to flee from this brutal reality. These dreams fuel our relentless push to the west, as our sailors brave the harshest seas, the stormiest nights, just for a brief glimpse at the verdant plains beyond the horizon."
 GDL_fourth:0 "Recruitment of the Highlanders"
 GDL_fourth_desc:0 "The Highlanders are a fierce and proud people. Their style of war has been honed in the mountains of Alba, where the rough terrain has made for even rougher soldiers. We shall use them within our armies for shock and awe tactics, brutal hit and run guerilla campaigns, and they shall be the brave souls to charge into the thick of fire."
 GDL_fifth:0 "The North Sea Fleet"
 GDL_fifth_desc:0 "The North Sea is our heartline for trade and travel. It has been rife with pirates, raiders, and heathens. For us to remain a world power and challenge the many threats that face us, we have to create a fleet to not only meet but surpass all others."
 GDL_sixth:0 "Development of Scottish Industry"
 GDL_sixth_desc:0 "The land of the Scots is home to vast quantities of minerals and livestock. As the age of trade and barter gives way to companies and markets, we must seek to corner the production aspect of supply and demand. We shall stand at the forefront of the era of industry and manufacturing, and the heartlands of Scotland shall be our backbone."
 GDL_seventh:0 "Fury of the Gaeilge"
 GDL_seventh_desc:0 "For far too long have we been attacked and oppressed by foreigners from abroad. The Anglo-Saxons, the Norse, and even the Romans all came to our land trying to subjugate and control our land. We shall stand against all invaders and threats to our people, standing strong as one. The Goidelic people cannot be defeated anymore!"
