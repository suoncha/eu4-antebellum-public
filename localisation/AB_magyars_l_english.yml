 magyar_tribal_union:0 "Magyar Tribal Union"
 magyar_tribal_union_desc:0 "Magyars are organized into a decentralized confederation of tribes that is officially ruled from Szeged, the seat of the Árpád dynasty. However, the central rule is very weak, which paralyzes the Magyar's ability to do anything but fight among themselves for the seat of the Grand Prince."
 mgygyula:0 "Revive Gyula and Kende"
 mgygyula_desc:0 "Magyar kingship was once divided between the sacred king, or Kende, and the military leader, or Gyula. This unique form of split governance allowed us to better adapt to military circumstance, while maintaining legitimacy. Let us revive this ancient tradition."
 mechanic_mgy_coruler_yes:0 "Select a §YCo-Ruler§! on monarch death. They will provide your ruler with the fourth personality trait at half efficiency."
 mgytaltos:0 "Empower the Táltos"
 mgytaltos_desc:0 "Similar to Shamans of other faiths, the Magyar Táltos are humans of supernatural abilities. Known for their spiritual powers of révülés they often serve as a bridge of communication between the gods and spirits and the Hungarian people, warning of impending doom. Granting them more privileges should inspire a certain amount of confidence amongst our armies."
 mgygreek:0 "Greek Liturgical Language"
 mgygreek_desc:0 "Our conversion to Orthodoxy has allowed us to tap into the vast Greek literary culture of our southern neighbors. This allows us to maintain a pace of rapid modernization."
 mgyslavic:0 "Slavic Auxiliaries"
 mgyslavic_desc:0 "While us Magyars are superb horseman, there are many more demeaning jobs in the army that need to be filled. Just as the Avars before us, or as our forefather Attila did with the Germans, we must recruit Slavs to fill ranks."
 mgyispan:0 "Ispán Marches"
 mgyispan_desc:0 "As one of the last pagan realms in Europe, our Christian neighbors are always looking to invade us if given the chance. Assigning border lands and their respective fortresses to court officials known as Ispán will allow us to maintain a strong defensive position against all our would be enemies."
 #Events
 magyar_events.5.t:0 "Settling Transdanubia"
 magyar_events.5.d:0 "When our ancestors entered Pannonia centuries ago, they sought to unite it all under the Magyar rule. Although they came close to achieving that goal, the defeat at the Battle of Pozsony forced our ancestors back behind the Danube, where we have stayed ever since. After centuries of internal struggle, we have finally managed to achieve a great victory over the Slavs of Pannonia, and have secured Transdanubia for ourselves. Now, we must decide the fate of the area."
 magyar_events.5.a:0 "We shall move the tribes across the Danube."
 magyar_events.5.b:0 "Let us integrate and protect the locals instead."
 magyar_events.6.t:0 "Gyula and Kende"
 magyar_events.6.d:0 "Our old ruler has passed, and while the Magyar tribes mourn his passing, the time has come for the new Grand Prince to select his new co-ruler. As we have reestablished the ancient tradition of the Gyula and Kende - a dual leadership that once guided our people in times of both war and peace, the choice must be made to elect the one who will step forward to claim this title."
 magyar_events.6.a:0 "Select someone skilled in administration."
 magyar_events.6.b:0 "We could use a diplomat."
 magyar_events.6.c:0 "Only the strong should rule!"
 magyar_events.7.t:0 "A New Capital"
 magyar_events.7.d:0 "Now that we control the Carpathian Basin, many voices within our realm have suggested that the seat of power should be moved to a more central location. In order to better project our influence over these lands, we must consider relocating the capital. The settlement of Buda, located near the ancient Roman camp of Aquincum, seems to be the most promising candidate for the new capital of our expanding domain."
 magyar_events.7.a:0 "Let us move our capital to Buda!"
 magyar_events.7.b:0 "Our capital is fine where it is"
 
 #Missions
 mgy_rise_of_the_horde_title:0 "Rise of the Horde"
 mgy_rise_of_the_horde_desc:0 "The time has come! Should we not arise from our pathetic infighting, we will be crushed and eradicated from living memory, like so many steppe peoples of old. We must start by restoring our army to its rightful strength!"
 mgy_conquer_nitra_title:0 "Conquer Nyitra"
 mgy_conquer_nitra_desc:0 "Left unattended, the meddlesome Moravians stand liable to seize the vulnerable lands of Carpathia. These lands are our own - as are those they believe themselves rightful to! Nyitra is a rich and prosperous land filled with metal, gold and wine - treasures for our deserving men!"
 mgy_moravian_deathblow_title:0 "Moravian Deathblow"
 mgy_moravian_deathblow_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the Moravians once ruled an empire. They soon stumbled and fell to their knees however. Opportunists as we were, we struck at the buffoons, hoping to seize Pannonia for ourselves. Before we could solidify rule however, the Franks crushed us at the Battle of Pozsony. Ever since, we have feared to transgress upon the Danube - shying at the mention of western expansion. This must be avenged and corrected!" 
 mgy_conquest_of_the_homeland_title:0 "Complete the Honfoglalás"
 mgy_conquest_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "Upon our fated arrival in the Carpathian Basin, it seemed self-evident that if we were to survive and persevere as a people, we would have to secure the region in its totality. Setback after setback has prevented us from reaching the zenith of the conquest. Now however, we are on the cusp - and once we are over it, Magyar identity will be forever solidified."
 mgy_break_the_slavic_bridge_title:0 "Break the Slavic Bridge"
 mgy_break_the_slavic_bridge_desc:0 "For centuries now, we have hungrily eyed the plains of Pannonia. It narrowly slipped through our fingers in the 10th century thanks to a spiteful Frankish incursion. Now that we are resurging in strength and determination, Pannonia seems vulnerable - perhaps it is fated to be ours after all."
 mgy_subjugate_the_romanians_title:0 "Romanian Subjugation"
 mgy_subjugate_the_romanians_desc:0 "Not even a century ago, we held Romania in our hands - lording over their unruly masses as their rightful masters, until those indignant Bulgars disturbed us. Under our wise ways and stern discipline, they were prospering! Happy, even! Probably happy, at least. Eh. They shall be happy again under our control!"
 mgy_return_to_etelkoz_title:0 "Return to Etelköz"
 mgy_return_to_etelkoz_desc:0 "Deep within our old history are tales of the land of Etelköz - a place where the rivers meet by the fateful Black Sea. There, our ancestors allowed their horses to graze until it was time to continue their great journey to our present homeland. Having gained a strength like no other, we now have the chance to retake this land, put our horses to rest their once again."
 mgy_ruin_ruthenia_title:0 "Ruin Ruthenia"
 mgy_ruin_ruthenia_desc:0 "A spiteful rabble of Slavic peoples rage about the river Dnieper and its humble offshoots. Miserable under the looming Tatar Yoke, they have developed a certain aversion to those of the steppe disposition. We must show them what benevolent and wonderful masters we can be! Their cities are simply too big - they could do with being trimmed! Their coffers are simply too heavy - they could do with being emptied! Such is our wise and merciful rule."
 mgy_challenge_the_borjigins_title:0 "Challenge the Borjigins"
 mgy_challenge_the_borjigins_desc:0 "Perhaps the most fearsome of all the free peoples, the Mongols have made a terrible mark upon the world. From the depths of mystical Asia to the precipice of cold Europe, their blight has been irrevocable. Countless millions have suffered - city dwellers, grain peasants and free tribes alike have toiled and wasted away beneath their cruelty. It would not only be an honour for us to contest and destroy them, but a mercy to the entire world."
 mgy_back_to_the_motherland_title:0 "Back to the Motherland"
 mgy_back_to_the_motherland_desc:0 "Many, many centuries ago, in a time before memory, our ancestors lived on the wild and free steppe. Forced by circumstance to begin migrating elsewhere, they soon happened upon the home we today know as the Carpathian Basin. We are sure though that despite our present successes, our ancestors would smile proudly upon us if we were to reclaim our first homeland proper."
 mgy_defeat_the_bulgars_title:0 "Defeat the Bulgars"
 mgy_defeat_the_bulgars_desc:0 "Ever since we first arrived in the Carpathian Basin, many centuries ago, we have had to endure the wrath of the Bulgars. Old rivals of ours, they have even suffered a similar history to us - migrating from the old and mystical steppe to find a new life in the Balkans. Such, they have been our eternal rivals, a thorn in our side. It is time to remove this thorn for good - and burn it!"
 mgy_sack_the_second_rome_title:0 "Sack the Second Rome"
 mgy_sack_the_second_rome_desc:0 "The Romans! Since time immemorial they have dwelt in that gilded city with those walls oh so high, occupying the bridge between ancient Asia and fabled Europe. Many a people have tried to take it to varying levels of success. We shall be the ones to conquer it for good!"
 mgy_balkan_domination_title:0 "Balkan Domination"
 mgy_balkan_domination_desc:0 "Along with the Bulgars, the assorted tribes, petty kingdoms and merchant localities of the Balkans have meddled with our affairs for too long. Many a fantastic raid south has been thwarted by a meddlesome mission for mercy. Should we dominate the Balkans once and for all, we would secure our southern flank and be able to drawn upon the plethora of manpower and resources for ourselves." 
 mgy_imperial_incursion_title:0 "Imperial Incursion"
 mgy_imperial_incursion_desc:0 "As with the Battle of Pozsony, the Holy Roman Empire, a lumbering beast of civil peoples masquerading as deities, has time and time again bloodied our nose. They have a tendency to unite and smash us at our most vulnerable, cowards that they are. With our strength on the rise, we must strike back - deal them a blow that puts them on the back-foot."
 mgy_pillage_the_west_title:0 "Pillage the West"
 mgy_pillage_the_west_desc:0 "Having dealt the Holy Roman Empire and its meddlesome princes a mortifying blow, the way lays open for further incursions. Our eager generals have identified a host of vulnerabilities within their eastern frontiers, as well as paths to the north in the wild and untamed lands of the Wends. We would be fools to not exploit them."
 mgy_reform_the_tribes_title:0 "Reform the Tribes"
 mgy_reform_the_tribes_desc:0 "Though the tribes are the pride of our culture, of our history, they have always had a tendency towards disunity. Cohesion is not the rule - it is a state we have always had to muster, encourage and enforce. So easily have the tribes questioned our word and jeopardised our conquests. We must put a stop to this and formally reorganise the tribal hierarchy." 
 mgy_rule_eastern_europe_title:0 "Rule Eastern Europe"
 mgy_rule_eastern_europe_desc:0 "With powerful footholds in Poland and the Balkans respectively secured, we may now turn our attention to Eastern Europe in its totality. These lands are flat and vulnerable, with little in the say of great powers and organised polities. If we do not destroy and assimilate these peoples, then someone else will." 
 mgy_composite_cavalry_title:0 "Composite Cavalry"
 mgy_composite_cavalry_desc:0 "Cavalry has been a fixture of our culture for many centuries - dare we say it, millennia. Though we have turned our energies to learning new technologies, new techniques, new tactics, we have never abandoned our greatest strength - that is, our unmatched command of horseback combat. We must not let this tradition go to waste - we must empower it!"
 mgy_selective_breeding_title:0 "Selective Horse Breeding"
 mgy_selective_breeding_desc:0 "Our ancestors spoke extensively on the cultivation of our herds - advising us, many centuries later via song and tradition alike, to breed out weakness in our mounts, to cherish endurance, tenacity, speed and loyalty in our steeds. By twining our martial prowess with a tradition of selective breeding, we may create the finest array of horses the world has ever seen."
 mgy_scourge_of_god_title:0 "Scourge of God"
 mgy_scourge_of_god_desc:0 "May the peasants of Europe, Asia, the world over, come to know us by the same name, under different Gods - that of his scourge, that of the great death to make their petty fortresses tremble."
 mgy_overpower_the_hordes_title:0 "Overpower the Hordes"
 mgy_overpower_the_hordes_desc:0 "Out in the depths of Central Asia, we meet likeminded tribes - people of steppe, riding brazenly on horseback. Though these cultures share more in common with us than the Balkan peasants we are accustomed to, they eye us with contempt - seeking to compete with us, not befriend us. We must destroy them before they destroy us!"
 mgy_mongol_subjugation_title:0 "Mongol Subjugation"
 mgy_mongol_subjugation_desc:0 "Once ruling a steppe empire greater than anything that has come before, the Mongols now sit in a disenfranchised, squabbling state - not dissimilar to what we were, not too long ago! Unfortunately, the sun has set on this tribe - we are the cruel night that will put them to sleep."
 mgy_burn_the_dragon_throne_title:0 "Burn the Dragon Throne"
 mgy_burn_the_dragon_throne_desc:0 "Tales have long told of a great and vast empire sitting beyond the eastern horizon. We've always known of the riches of the Silk Road, exploited it and traded with it to no end - but never could we have fathomed its source. The cities of China are truly a marvel to behold, even from afar - we cannot imagine what manner of riches we may seize by launching our own invasion."
 mgy_great_stables_title:0 "Great Stables of Szeged"
 mgy_great_stables_desc:0 "Szeged's Great Stables - a timeless fixture of our beautiful Békés - have done us well, but as our armies have grown and our conquests have unfolded, we have come to rely on them more and more. Thus, they are in dire need of an expansion to continue serving our needs."
 mgy_highway_of_doom_title:0 "Highway of Doom"
 mgy_highway_of_doom_desc:0 "The success of the great hordes, such as the Mongols, was not merely in their swift and fearsome warriors, but in the infrastructure that sustained them. They built vast networks of roads and waystations, such as the Caravanserai, allowing their mounted armies to move at breakneck speed, rest, and strike at will. It is time we take a lesson from these masters of warfare. Our new road system will bring doom to all who stand against us. Let none escape the shadow of the Magyar horde!"
 mgy_recruit_riders_title:0 "Recruit New Riders"
 mgy_recruit_riders_desc:0 "Across our realm, young men yearn for a place in our armies. Unfortunately they lack in experience, strength, equipment and training. Where they lack however, we may provide, by constructing new stables, barracks, training fields. As the peasants grow their grain, we grow our warriors - we thus need farms!"
 mgy_military_infrastructure_title:0 "Expand Military Camps"
 mgy_military_infrastructure_desc:0 "Sizeable as our military infrastructure is, it is still meagre when compared to that of greater Europe. Owing to their coin and admittedly functional institutions, they have financed camps and academies of impressive scales. If we could copy some of their designs, we could surely boost our manpower in no time."
 mgy_supply_the_horde_title:0 "Supply the Horde"
 mgy_supply_the_horde_desc:0 "We face unique problems as a horde. Namely, our armies are always on the move - where they move, they do so incredibly quickly, often outpacing not only our enemies, but our own supply chains, too. To cope, we must build an efficient chain of military rations and goods, as well as a means of quickly building supply depots in vital locations."
 mgy_religious_dispute_title:0 "Matters of Religion"
 mgy_religious_dispute_desc:0 "The Pagan Koppany and the Christian Vajk - baptised Stephen - once fought a brutal and sad war over the Basin's religious destiny. Centuries on, we eye Europe's current religious squabbling with nervous uncertainty. We do not want another such war of our own. We must secure our religious identity swiftly, whatever it may be."
 mgy_black_soil_title:0 "The Black Soil of Pannonia"
 mgy_black_soil_desc:0 "Our ancestors dutifully noted, upon arriving in Carpathia, that the soil here is of a peculiar quality - begging for a wise and benevolent farming people to come and respect its worth. We would be fools to neglect it. While our armies raze and rampage abroad, our more peaceful population can tend to the ancient land and provide for the country."
 mgy_basket_title:0 "Breadbasket of Europe"
 mgy_basket_desc:0 "With agriculture booming by our hand, we stand to become a powerful exporter of grain in Europe, a breadbasket, as Egypt is to the arid south. Not only will we wield unprecedented military prowess over the continent, but so too will we be richer than even the most wily merchants."
 mgy_intercontinental_trade_title:0 "Continental Trade"
 mgy_intercontinental_trade_desc:0 "Sitting at the end of the Silk Road, joining the trade of Asia to the reaches of Europe, we have an opportunity to monopolise, to cast a watchful eye upon all that passes between. Like the hordes of old, we will be benevolent masters of trade - profiting as a result."
 mgy_the_magyar_yoke_title:0 "The Magyar Yoke"
 mgy_the_magyar_yoke_desc:0 "It is time to show the remaining Rus' principalities the might of the Magyar horde. Just as their ancestors once knelt before the Mongols, so too shall the last of these independent states bow before our rule."
 mgy_grip_over_the_steppe_title:0 "Grip Over the Steppe"
 mgy_grip_over_the_steppe_desc:0 "In order to forge a stable nomad empire spanning the steppes of Eurasia, we must ensure that the nomadic people of the steppe treat our great horde as their own."
