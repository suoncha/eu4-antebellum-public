#Shortly before the start, Asti is subjugated by Ivrea. After the defeat at Valencia decimates the troops of Alessandro Aleramici and he barely escapes with his life, Ivrea swoops in and besieges him and forces him into vassalage. 0-1 dip cause he’s a dummy when it comes to political maneuvering, 5-6 mil since he’s an otherwise good general, 2-3 adm for balance.
